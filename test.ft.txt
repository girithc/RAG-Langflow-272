__label__1 Resurection Day: How many of other readers purchased this book and got to page 277 and found the pages blank to 477? The store it was purchased at was going to just exchange it however in review of the 5 they had in stock, all had the same blank pages. The store then refunded my money. The book was great up until then.
__label__2 Purrfect: These shoes are a little high price wise, but you can't beat the convenience. Right at your doorstep and back into childhood for just a few extra dollars. No brainer. Will be back for more.
__label__2 Really nice shoes: These are good shoes. They have a classic look and the monochrome look adds a nice little something something. A good, safe buy.
__label__2 red converse: Converse Unisex Chuck Taylor All Star Plaid Hi SneakerGreat shoes at a great price! My daughter loves them :)
__label__2 Size is off: I love these shoes and have owned many Chuck Taylor Converse shoes for 30 years. I did forget that when getting this shoe I must order a size smaller than my regular shoe size. This can be frustrating when ordering shoes online, so don't forget to order 1size down :)
__label__1 Not for me: I'm accustomed to Dansko, Sanita, and Allegria shoes, which are all very comfortable, but require a break in period. I'm ok with that. But these never seemed to get broken in. Maybe my feet are just used to soles on my regular brands. I'm on my feet 9 hours a day, on concrete, walking around and up and down stairs, for several miles a day, sometimes with long periods standing (I'm an adult-education instructor). I have heard so many great things about chucks and really wanted a different shoe I could wear from time to time, and was hoping these would be it. I wear a 10 (40) in women's and the 8.5 chucks fit my foot well (thankful I read the other reviews and knew what size to order) but they just aren't the shoe for me.
__label__2 awesome shoes.: awesome shoes. what can i say. look great with pants, jeans, khakis. whatever. versatile, durable, sylish. you won't regret this purchase. maybe run a half size bigger than my size. but it's iffy.
__label__1 Linen Chef Jacket: This chef coat is very, very large (I ordered a med.) if you are a ladies size 16 or larger this may fit you -- but the coat has no shaping whatsoever -- so you will look like a big marshmallow (mine is white) -- also, where the collar meets at the neck has a very large space -- which is not traditional and looks very odd. The fabric quality is OK, which for the price is not so great. Perhaps this was cut for men, but the buttons and fabric would make it too girly. This coat design needs to be amended and shaped and the overlap (where the buttons cross over) needs to be re-thought as the fabric hangs down and bunches under the coat -- so the bottom hem is not 'clean' -- it needs a button underneeth or something to stop that from happening.
__label__2 One of the greatest plays in English Literature: I have read this play and also performed the part of Joan on stage many times. Shaw's play brings the soul of Joan to life. A girl with no formal education - defeated the English, won a crown for a king, and was tried and burned as a witch - dead at or under the age of 23. No wonder she was made a saint. The story would almost be a horrible fairy tale, if it wasn't true.
__label__2 Gorgeous music gorgeously played: I will not usually recommend a mono CD unless there is no other version of the work in question or the performance is superlative. Well, there are many recent CDs filled with "the antique music," but none bear up so well as the Amadeus reissue of the 1961 <Instrumental Music of 1600> (AMD 7007) as performed by the Concentus Musicus Wien under Nikolaus Harnoncourt, the man who was one of the pioneers of "period instruments" in recordings. Here we have 23 cuts of music from France (du Tertre, du Caurroy), England (Holborne, Morley, Tomkins, Cooper, Bevin), Germany (Sommer, Posch, Scheidt), and Italy (Cabrielli, Gumai, Massaino), all of which is available elsewhere and perhaps some of which is played as well and in better sound. I will deduct a rating-point, however, for its short running time of 46 minutes. But all in all, this is gorgeous music gorgeously played.
__label__2 If you read only 1 book about the death penalty, read this!: This well-written book examines virtually all arguments regarding the death penalty. In addition to exposing current practices, Just Revenge also puts the death penalty in an historical context. Its inevitable conclusion, as it demolishes every well-cherished but incorrect justification for the death penalty (with the exception of a clause in the 5th Amendment) , is that the only thing proponents have left on their side is indeed just revenge. Mark Costanzo's own opinion is clear virtually from the start, but he backs it up with fact after devastating fact. If you want to learn more about the death penalty, this is an excellent place to begin. It is also a useful reference book as it is chock-full of statistics and anecdotes.
__label__2 Great but: These caps are hard to find. Being a deputy sheriff it is a necessary item to have. I have put it to good. Use and found it to be recognizable and protective. Best yet, the price was reasonable for a quality product.
__label__2 good: Thank you, this item was exactly what I wanted it to be. It is a good purchase on my part. thanks!
__label__1 hate it: I have been reading this book in my intro to native american studies.. and I hate it... I feel it give the wrong image towards northwest native history...
__label__1 Be careful scrapbookers!!! This is NOT like the original Cropper Hopper!: Be careful scrapbookers!!! This is NOT like the original Cropper Hopper! It is not deep enought to fit 12X12 paper. Don't make the same mistake I did!
__label__1 Poor product from dishonest dealer: Ordered two, and billed for two, as Christmas presents. Received one, which was a misassembled plastic piece of garbage. Oh well, my fault for buying jewelry over the net. Should, at least, receive what I ordered, however. So I wrote the dealer to either send the second one or issue a refund. Never could get a reply. Threw the one that had arrived in the trash. Would have given this a negative rating, if "1" were not the lowest number available.
__label__1 unseen is the word: I read this book two years ago and had the opportunity to participate in an interview with the author on National Public Radio. Ms. Gibbons was gracious, of course, but she could not answer the obvious difficulties in this book. The chronology is confused, and while the book reaches for important issues, ie the need for a young girl to have a mother, the treatment of the characters is shallow. The longing is there, and it is expressed well, but ultimately, the miraculous "healing" of the mother and her immediate death after her restoration--undermine whatever strength was in the novel.The one character that the reader has no trouble believing is Pearl, the caring maternal housekeeper. She is a jewel of characterization, much needed and appreciated in this novel.
__label__1 Definitely not Prodigy's best material: Maybe it's because I've been listening to the energetic and inspired electronic music of german industrial/EBM for the past few years. Or perhaps it's just Prodigy did not put enough effort into this release. Whatever the reason, I can't recommend this single...Baby's Got A Temper just does not catch the attention of my ears. In ways it does mimic the style of a few of Prodigy's past songs with the break beats and repeating synth lines, but it just can't match the magic of their former hits like Breathe and Firestarter. The remixes of Baby's Got A Temper are not really that much to look forward to on this single either. Even die-hard Prodigy fans should find somewhere to listen to this single first before buying it. Hopefully Prodigy's upcoming album will incorporate some more inspired songs for redemption from this lackluster single.
__label__2 Great tune!: The Prodigy are back!"Baby's Got A Temper" is a fantastic record - just whatwe need right now in an age where all the music industryhas to offer is endless, dire amounts of pop-garbage.The only bad thing I have to say about this great CD isthat the other mixes don't vary too much from the originaltrack, being a dub and instrumental (respectively). I wouldhave preferred a couple of new tracks.That said, "Baby's Got A Temper" is such a great,catchy song, that I still enjoy the other versions and Ijust can't get enough of the tune itself anyway!:) Great video too!!Absolutely recommended!
__label__2 One of the Best Metal Albums of All Time!: The first song I heard on this album was "Bounce," and to be quite honest, I wasn't impressed. But I saw the CD at Best Buy, and thought, "Why not." I must say it has not been something I've regretted. This is nu-metal years ahead of any other band you will find out there, with insightful underlying political protest all the way through. But if you want an album to just rock out to... well this is actually an amazing choice anyway. There is some amazing stuff here. Like "Chop Suey!" a deeply touching/disturbing song about the unpleasant topic of suicide and "Toxicity" a song about the terrible disorder in the world. With the split of Rage Against the Machine, there is little possible competition for System on their way to the nu-metal top.
__label__2 Good but doesn't top the first one: As much as I enjoyed System of A down's first effort, it took me a long time to get into this one. But I guess i'm like that with every new cd a band comes out with. Anyway. I think that on this cd Serj shows more of his vocal ability to go really high than down to a near death metal scream in prison song, but I was disapointed that the drummer, did not do any crazy drum solos as he did on the band's self-titled debut. All in all i really enjoyed this cd and I would highly recommend for anyone who is starting to get into metal or into System of a down. The single "Chop Suey!" is definitely one of the songs where the bands demonstrates the most musical talent in my opininon. Although the sound of the song is a bit more radio-friendly than the rest of the cd, it is still a great song. Another song with great talent is the song "Toxicity" which has proven to become my favorite on this multi-faceted album.
__label__2 COOL: Awsome cd...almost evry song is worth listening to...prison song,pogo,and chop suey are all realy good.
__label__2 Overall pretty good: I'm going to make this short and sweet: it's not the greatest album in the world because I still can't listen to the whole thing straight through, but I just have to say that "Toxicity" is one of my most favorite songs in the world, you just can't beat the guitars in this song, and the drums are amazing! "Chop Suey!" is also great, it's got interesting allusions to God and Jesus, "Psycho" is good headbanging fun (and warns you to stay away from cocaine too!), and "Aerials" is nice and meaningful. Oh, and "Bounce" is hilarious... but I'll leave it up to you to buy the album and figure out what they're really talking about.
__label__1 [bad deal]: Listin to The velvet underground's Murder Mystery and then listen to chop suey. You can not tell me they didn't rip that intro from the velvets.I Dont care about this CD I just felt like saying that they ripped the velvet underground's murder mystery off.
__label__1 I may have enjoyed this album, had i been deaf!: I may have enjoyed this album, had i been 14 years old or deaf. Strangely enough i listen to new and old metal but there is somethin about this band i dont like, #1 his voice is very annoying from the get go, where are they going with this garbage.Its been awhile since weve seen some fresh new metal/music that is decent and i have a feeling something is coming cause if it isnt,i dont think this genre will be pop much longer.
__label__2 Real good music.: This CD is really , really awesome. It's not that i only like this heavy metal/rock genre. Quite frankly, i like every type of music, besides country, that is.(heh) This is a review coming a person who likes everything from Dido to Disturbed. rap, rock, whatever, i like it all. This is just a really good CD for anyone who likes any music at all and also has very good taste. Very great work from SOAD that should be enjoyed by everyone
__label__2 One of Systems Best Albums: Along with their self titled album, these two are the best albums I have heard ever by any group.
__label__2 Awesome!!: This is one bad [rear] group! I have both of their albums and the only problem is that I listen to them so much that I can't get the songs out of my head.Killer lyrics and wonderful beats. You won't be disappointed.
__label__1 Bunch of Garbage: There is only 2 good songs on this cd and you here them on the radio all the time. This is depressing dreadful music I wanted to slash my wrist after listening to it but instead I broke it and toss it in the trash can were it belongs.
__label__2 shock to the system: Upon hearing the song Toxicity on MTV I had absolutely no hesitation in buying this album knowing that it would contain at least one gem. What I didn't expect was such consistency.Initially tracks like X and Forest do not stand out as much as MTV hits Chop Suey! and Toxicity, however on further listens you will discover that it is the lesser known tracks that hold your interest and ensure this album stays in your cd player for a while. I now hope to see these guys live at some stage to see if the energy displayed on this album translates as well in live performance.
__label__2 Buy this cd!: This is a great cd.I have listened to this cd probably 20 times and it never gets old.All the songs are good.
__label__1 Complete Liberal Garbage!!: This music is sooo old and tired. These punks are your typical angry Californians...you know the ones..."Lets all Riot, and then cry discrimination when the Police arrest us for commiting crimes, lets overthrow the corupt government, the government puts too many people in jail" etc, etc. Blah Blah. (...) Anyway, musically the CD is average, and lirically the CD is terrible. Only a cute video and MTV's air play (...) have brought commercial success to these sad sacks. (...)
__label__1 Um......: Ok..... Chop suey is the only good song on this cd.. if u expect that this cd will be like there Last LP that's where your wrong.. they seem to have a christian\gospel touch...insted more of a heavy metal\rock touch... if u want some real metal\rock try Slipknot,Static-x,Disturbed,Slayer,pentara and more artists like that.
__label__2 NAZTECH CABRIO CASE: NICE CASE. GOOD QUALITY. PHONE FIT A BIT SNUG TO START BUT LOOSENING UPAND FITTING BETTER WITH TIME.
__label__2 Excellent for Female Infertility & Ave. for male infertility: If you want one book to do it all, get this one.At least it provides you with a vision of most of the issues surrounding infertility.It provides excellent information on female infertility issues.It provides cursory information about male infertility issues.We have recommended and loaned out this book to several friends, and they all were happy with the details provided.
__label__2 must read: I love this series! It's funny, inspirational, and adventerous! We started this series in a small church group and all of us are loving it!
__label__2 Amazing book for future study in Tort Law: I would recommend this book to law students in both pre-law and law school. Well written and covers important cases.
__label__1 global puzzle: poor Adam Crall, reviewer. Cameroon is its own, French-speaking nation in Africa. It is NOT in South Africa, which is also an independent nation.
__label__2 Cool puzzle, not highest quality pieces: We are really enjoying this puzzle, and learning a lot. The information written on the oceans makes the puzzle more interesting and manageable.The pieces are necessarily very small to match the size of the countries. The bigger problem is that they curl up just a bit, so the pieces don't lie flat as you make the puzzle. This is frustrating, and you don't get that satisfying feeling as you put a piece in, as you have to press it down a few times and it still doesn't quite flatten down. I'm trying covering the finished puzzle with heavy books, but I suspect it's just a problem of cheap glue.Still, I give it four stars since a good world puzzle is very hard to find, and the content is good.
__label__1 I'll Pass on this next time.: Bought 2 of these with the idea of keeping one and giving the other to my mother. Neither worked well and failed soon after using. The seller was magnificent and refunded our money.
__label__2 New Developments for the middle of a series: I thought that this was a positive development in the series bringing in new characters and expanding on the plot world's development. The first part is devoted to developing new characters and expanding threads while the last third is action with the characters. This has a lot of foreshadowing and will fit in with follow books and new series. Overall worthwhile. Reads best when in conjunction with the other books in the series.
__label__2 Another top-notch film about Victoria by Victoria: Victoria Hamilton seems to pop up everywhere, whether in lesser parts as in Pride and Prejudice, in "bad girl" parts such as in Mansfield Park, or in this delightful version of the complex relationship between Victoria and Albert. This one needs to be compared with a somewhat different interpretation of the relationship in "The Young Victoria." Victoria's handling of her long period of grief over Albert's death is also well done in "Mrs Brown." For English history lovers, all of these are worth viewing, interesting, and nicely filmed.
__label__2 Pure Pop for Moog People: Electronic power pop that sounds fresh to this day. The beats are more bubblegum punk than straight-up dance music. The songs have hooks the Archies would kill for: Catchy, and completely addictive. You can bet your modern day synthpop bands like Ladytron, Freezepop, Hyperbubble, and Bis listened to this stuff in their sleep. Many say it's Depeche Mode at their best, many disagree. Whatever the case, there's no other DM album like it, and every song is great. If you eat this electrocandy up and want more, there are a few more Speak and Spell moments on DM's second album.Comment | Why no voting buttons?

__label__2 Satisfying your supernatural cravings: If you like battles against ultimate evil, religious overtones, and special effects - with a twist, rent Constantine. Yes, you have to suspend disbelief. Yes, you have to accept somewhat two-dimensional personalities. But if you get past that, you get a nicely shot, tense, supernatural crime saga with a couple of interesting characters. Most folks will have never heard of Constantine or Hellblazer, on which the movie is loosely based, but it's fine if you haven't. The movie is good enough on its own for an enjoyable night.
__label__1 Lamebrain to the hill.: Lamebrain film that not only rips off a much better film out there (The prophecy) but also lacks the thrills that movie had in spades. Keanu Reeves is still his same self here, which means that he gives another boring acting turn. His fellow co-stars do far more in their parts with Rachel Weisz being the stand out, giving a great performance that has resonance and guts. Djimon Hounsou is good as well but he's barley in the film plus Peter Stormare and Tilda Swinton have great cameos that really should have been bigger roles. Weisz, Hounsou Stormare and Swinton give far more acting weight to this lame brain horror movie than it deserved and for that, they are worthy of the praise (Especially Rachel Weisz, who does lift this movie above the mediocre garbage it's really is.) but regardless of their worthy acting turns, the movie is plague by a script that really does not make any sense and a director who does no know how to direct a movie.
__label__1 Overblown Mess: This is bad. Really. Perhaps it is one of those movies which can only be fully understood or enjoyed if familiar with the comic that originated it. It does not even have the redeeming quality of being a decent action film. Guilty of the worst capital sin of the kingdom of entertainment: boring, boring and boring. For that alone, it will burn in cinematic hell.
__label__1 Where is Mystery Science Theater 3000 when you really need it?: Extremely awful Keanu Reeves stinker that not only lives up to the word of mouth but surpasses it in spades. Keanu proves once and for all on how bad an actor he is with a groundbreaking bad performance and a script that helps him out a lot in proving that. Only his co-stars come out of this film with their heads held up high with great performances by Rachel Weisz, Djimon Hounsou, and Peter Stormare but not even their great performances can salvage this disaster. This is fresh material for the show " Mystery Science Theater 3000" and I hope they can get a print of this movie and tear it apart for the garbage it really is.
__label__1 Weak, very weak.: Dumb Keanu Reeves horror epic that is not only the actors worse film by far but a bad film in it's own right. Keanu is just wrong for the role and the script is joke in many ways. Most of the performances are not very good. (Shia LaBeouf was horrible and made Keanu look like an Oscar winner by comparison) The only performance of merit is that of Rachel Weisz and she literally keeps you glued to your seat with her powerful and emotional performance. Unfortunately, while she gives her all, the rest of the movie is in self destruction mold all around her with bad special effects, very bad dialog and a story that makes no sense what so ever.I stand with the majority, Rachel Weisz is the only good thing about this film, so wait for Dvd to see this film and in the mean time rent Runaway Jury or the Shape of things. Two very good movies that compliment Weisz's performance unlike this one does.
__label__1 Should have read the reviews before I saw it.: Terrible adaptation of the great comic book "Hellblazer" is nothing short of a spit in the eye of the fans of the comic book with a terrible and down right crude performance by Keanu Reeves, who makes a joke out of one of the most beloved cult comic book characters made in the last twenty years. His performance is bad to the point of wanting to throw something at the screen just out of sheer rage. The screenplay is a joke and the dialog rages from bad to much worse as the movie progresses and the special effects are so badly done that the monsters would have been better off if they were puppets instead. Some of the actors in the film are better than the film itself with great performances by Rachel Weisz, who is the only ray of light this movie really has and Djimon Hounsou, who is the only actor who does his comic book character any justice. Despite Rachel Weisz, the movie is bad and not even her talent could have saved it.
__label__2 Finally I can pre-order the DVD!: I haven't been able to get this movie out of my head. I love it, it was such a brilliant take on the comic book adaption. Sure, I was disappointed at first about the casting choice to play constantine, but it turned out so much better than I expected and I grew to love it. I can't wait for a sequel!Reeves did an outstanding job capturing the spirit of John Constantine, and Rachel Weisz gave her all. The two had such great chemistry and I am thankful they didn't overplay the relationship thing by not overfluffing the movie. It's a great flick you should consider adding this to your collection.Kudos to Francis Lawrence for doing such an outstanding job as a first time movie director.
__label__2 creepy cool: Constantine has accepted his fate and made peace with it. He knows that death and a hellish afterlife are imminent. Flawed and fatalistic, cigarette between his fingers, he plods along throwing himself into one horrific situation after another, in an effort to help a woman he doesn't even know. It's creepy and powerful. Angels, devils and friends. The guilty and innocent. Keanu Reeves is perfect in this role and it's a movie to watch again and again. Liked it a lot. Reminds me of Sandman Slim stories.
__label__1 Why did Warner Brothers release this garbage?: This movie is garbage, stay home and save your money. My friendsand I were trying to stay awake through the entire film, although I don't know why. Sleeping would have been a more productive use of our time, rather than wasting time trying to figure out this film. When the old tired plot finally starts to unravel, we didn't care what was going on. I felt that the actors are an insignificant part of this movie, they don't matter. In other words, this film is so bad, it doesn't matter who was in front of the camera, no one could save this trash. The film is very dark, shot like a low budget film, with a few special effects.My friends and I can honestly say that we did not like anything about this film.
__label__2 Yay: Some wear and tear on the case, but other than that the DVD itself works great, thanks so much :)
__label__2 Good Movie!: this is a decent movie to get a good fright to lol just as good as when i saw it in theaters. i have the dvd and blu-ray now, time to ditch the dvd lol 4 Stars!
__label__1 What the HELL were they thinking?: Horrible adaptation of the vertigo comic book is not only a smack in the face of the followers of the book with a flat out moronic screenplay that takes all the good out of the comic but also has the worse actor to play the title role of John Constantine. Keanu Reeves not only makes the role into a joke with his lack of talent but makes everyone around him look bad as well. The cinematography is ugly, making the movie a real eye sour and the special effects lack a certain feel to it. Out of the entire cast, only Rachel Weisz comes out with her dignity intact with a very good performance that the movie squanders in order to let Keanu act like a darker version of his NEO character towards the latter half of the film. They should have taken the material seriously and made a great horror movie out of it but instead, we have a children's movie that geared to Matrix heads.Avoid this film like the plague.
__label__1 AWFUL.....................: My goodness. I rented this movie expecting a scary thriller and it almost put me to sleep. This is Keanu Reeves' Sorriest performance to date...... not that he has had many good ones. His acting was horrible in this movie and the whole movie did not make sense and was just plain Boring to watch. I was very disappointed for this film is just plain awful!!!!!!!
__label__1 Dumb and pretty bad.: What do you get when you have an actor who can't act, a director who can't direct and a script that is so badly written that you will be laughing your head off at the same time you are throwing up at the pure stupidity of it? You get one of the worse movies ever made. Keanu Reeves performance in this film is so bad, it makes his Bill and Ted movies look Oscar worthy. The direction from first time Director Frances Lawrence is flat out horrible with lousy direction and murky cinematography and the script is so badly written that you are really surprise by what you are hearing from the actors' mouths from time to time. Of all the actors involved only Rachel Weisz and are able to come out of this horrible film with their dignity intact with good performance that this movie really did not deserved. Other than them, almost everybody involved should hang their heads in shame for making such a bad movie.
__label__1 Pure stupidly: Horrible and down right stupid Keanu Reeves action/horror movie not only makes the people who pay to see it look stupid but it solidify him as one of the worse actors of our generation with a horrible performance that makes everything about this film into a joke. I feel sorry for his fellow actors which Includes Rachel Weisz, (who give the movie's only real performance) for even being on the same screen with him because despite their good work and effort, he manages to make the movie into a real choir to watch.The word of mouth is justified for this piece of garbage.
__label__1 Pretty bad: Very bad Keanu Reeves film that could be one of the worse films ever made. Keanu sinks it up so badly that he should be thrown out of Hollywood all together and they should include the director and the screenwriters as well because the movie is as bad as Keanu's performance. Out of the entire cast only Rachel Weisz gives a real performance in this movie and she is so good in fact that she does almost redeems the entire film but not even her great talent could save it from the script, which is excruciatingly bad and the direction, which is as bad as the script and lacks focus for what its trying to accomplish. The story makes no sense and manages to go against itself in certain scenes and the climax literally destroys the narrative that the movie was trying to build up.Maybe asking for a competed director and a lead actor who can act was a tall order for the producers of this film.
__label__1 Makes Hellboy look like a masterpiece.: Dimwitted supernatural thriller that is a major bore for the most part with a dimwitted performance by Keanu Reeves, who is miscast in the main role and a screenplay that is as stupid as it can be. A lot has been said about Rachel Weisz being the only good thing that this movie has to offer and I will agree with that assessment because she does make you care about what is going on with the movie while you are trying to figure out a way to care about the dumb story that is being told. Weisz's performance is much too rich and powerful for a movie like this and she gives you a reason to stick around while in essence there is no reason to even stay till the end. Hellboy was a masterpiece compared to this and that was marginal decent for what it was at the very best.For Weisz's rich and powerful performance, I give the movie two stars. If she were not in the movie, my rating would be in negative numbers. -0.
__label__1 Not even a B movie a Z minus movie: Truly a pathetic film.The only few minutes of the film that was interesting was the very beginning after this it raced downhill.The Demons and characters were all unbelievable except for the female lead. I can not fathom the audience for this film except for the blind, deaf and dumb. I have never been a fan of Keanu Reeves but some of his films have been exciting. He brought nothing to this nothing. It is hard to tell whether the fault is the script the director or the actor. In short the film was a total waste of time. More than that it was a total theft of time.
__label__1 Comment on CONSTANTINE: I did not like the movie as the dialogue was whispered and it was difficult to understand what was being said, and to make it even more objectionable, the audio level would overwhelm when the scene cut to an action event. The audio level had to be constantly adjusted and the picture was not very sharp even with a Hi-Def monitor. It is suggested Amazon get a limiting amplifier or one of the old CBS Audiomax units like TV broadcasters used in the 60's to prevent the commercials' audio levels from annoying the viewers. Run ALL movies through an audio processor and get this under control.Jim
__label__1 This was the worse.: Horrible can't describe this movie in a right light. This was the worse film I have seen in years and this should prove once and for all on how bad Keanu Reeves is as an actor because he's at his worse in this film. He's so bad that he has the uncanny ability to make you feel stupid once the movie is over, that's how bad he is. The script is a huge mess and most of it does not make sense what so ever and the picture is way too dark in certain areas of the film. Rachel Weisz is great in the movie but she's basically carrying Keanu on her shoulders during most of the film while he over acts in horrific ways and she is stranded with a story that really should have had a good rewrite before it became a shooting script. Other than her, the movie is just a huge help of crap that should not have been made.
__label__1 Rachel Weisz is great but the movie is a disaster.: Not very good horror action movie that has the right stuff but lacks a certain amount of credibility to mix. Keanu Reeves is semi-fine but miscast and he lacks a character the audience can root for and the rest of the movie is hit or miss in terms of the script which is badly written and the special effects which are not up to par in terms of what has been accomplish recently. I have to agree with what has been said about Rachel Weisz, who is the heart and soul of this movie and she does lift it over the mediocre script and funny dialog. Her performance is golden and worthy of a much better movie.See it for her alone but you will end up feeling sorry for her for being the only good thing about the whole movie.
__label__2 Additional Info: Didn't see this listed but if you put the supplimental disc in an X-box you can play the Constantine video game.
__label__2 good strong tires: I brought this tires for a friend in 26 x 1.75 she hasn't had a problem nor has she had a flat and she loves them....
__label__1 Be careful: I bought this tire for asphalt and cement roads, like it's name [ city ride ], but after using them for some monthsI noticed that if you have them with too much pressure the on bumps the bike can hit pretty hard and you can lose the control if you are not prepared; better to use low pressure.But the most problematic situation is the grip. I got into an emergency brake, a car show up in front of me, the driver was distracted, then the tire was completely stopped but slipping because it has zero grip because the center part which that is smooth is too wide.I am planning to create some groove to them just to using some more time.If you want your life don't buy this tire. I trust Continental but this was a failure. I can't imagine this tire in rainy conditions.
__label__2 PRAISE THE LORD: I FOUND THIS BOOK VERY USEFUL Being a practicing Christan and not being into WICCA or Witchcraft I have never had the occassion to purchase a book on candle burning before now. I had always associated such practices and being associated with Satan worship. Boy was I dead wrong. The author says that candle burning is a positive force in the universe...and not at all negative like I had thought. I got out my Bible and did one or two of the candle burning spells and found that the room was immediately energized with white light all around. I felt very peaceful . . . I had wanted to help someone in my family overcome a bad situation in their life (its somewhat of a personal matter so I wont go into it here), and a few days later I received a phone call from the family member and it turned out what I had prayed for using this book came about.I have given this book to others to use and they also report very positive benefits so I would recommend it to anyone who asked.
__label__1 WASTE WASTE WASTE: All I reall have to say is this book is a complete waste of time and money. DONT BOTHER!
__label__2 Good for price: Yellow plastic not matched to metal portions perfectly, but okay. It was good for the price. Still don't know what the reference to gerber was.
__label__1 Inedible: I made this gum with my 8 and 4 year old daughters. I ended up making 99.9% of the recipe myself. The gum is impossible to stir and never had a smooth consistancy. The food coloring (red and blue) stain everything and is impossible to get off of your hands...you HAVE to use you hands to knead the gum. The worst part is that even after all of that, the gum tasted terrible! I highly doubt that the manufacturer truely tested this process with parents and children. Frustrating and a waste of time.
__label__1 Delivery time too slow: From the time of order to receipt, the book took longer than any vendor I've ordered from previously. There were no courtesy notification of when the item was sent to gauge the time of delivery. The condition of the book was as promised. Overall, I wouldn't order from the same vendor again.
__label__2 The Black Crowes are incredible!!: One of the last great southern rock bands is back, and in a big way! By Your Side is a great cd which conveys the southern rock and roll styles that has been sorely missed for the past few years. This is true rock and roll at it's finest. If you enjoy Aerosmith or the Rolling Stones, I recommend this cd. The first single "Kickin My Heart Around" sums up what the Crowes are about. They might not have the most talent in the world, but they are great at what they do, rock hard! A must hear!
__label__2 Man of Many Trades: This book taught: That we can master more than one trade, That we should invest in ourselves and be our own bosses, That organization begins at home, and more.
__label__2 At first he seems just an ordinary kid...but wow what a life: This is a marvelous book and an easy read. Even though Ben Franklin seemed to be just an average guy, as you read about him accomplishing one thing after another, you get a sense of his magnificence as a man.I wish I had read this book when I was a kid, perhaps a little of the diligence that is portrayed on every page would have rubbed off on me.The autobiography is amazing in a low key, Ben Franklin sort of way.
__label__2 Good insight to Ben Franklin: I had heard many different things about Ben Franklin, one of the historical figures in the establishment of the United States. This book confirmed some things I had heard and debunked some others. Good book.
__label__2 I wish I had read this earlier: This book was written to instruct and encourage young people (men, in those days--but it can apply to anyone) to live a simple and productive life. Franklin learned early the unpleasantness of being in debt and in trouble with others, and made for himself a rule of life, which he strove daily to adhere to. He quickly learned that advice from others can be mistaken and the necessity of evaluating what others prescribed. He gives a good account of a prudent life, but does not spare himself, clearly declaring when he was at fault or mistaken. I wish I had read this when I was young--I might have been more consistent and productive.
__label__1 ben franklin: dont believe we received this book ...could you verify where it was sent and whenwas this a kindle fire book
__label__1 boring: I was hoping to really get in to this but it was to boring for me. So that is why it is one star.
__label__1 Not for the Southern Hemisphere.: Quite a well thought out book to take around with you.BUT... limited use to me as there are no Southern Hemisphere maps or details (even the Southern Cross is absent).Would not have purchased it had I realised. At least it was cheap!
__label__1 johny heeering, I am a fan, I DIDN"T dig it....: The magic just isn't here anymore. I think that every cramps fiend's affection comes from the fact that these guys struggled through pretty much every kind of hardship a band can face (except for a lack of purpose, drive, and motivation) throughout the wild and wooly days of the early punk scene. even the punks didn't get these guys. This album is just too artificial sounding to be a real cramp's album. it sounds like a novelty album for kids. I loved "sinners", though. and for that I gave it another star.
__label__1 Kindle version: You cannot search terms.. every time you try using kindle search it brings up on average over 40 pages.This is not worth almost 10dollars for kindle version. Your better off with print. The kindle is not designed to scroll pages quickly say like when your with friends.
__label__1 Almost too bad for MST3K...: This was one of the worst Sci Fi movies ever! You have to turn the car off or the EM pulse will fry it? Pretty sure it will still fry the electronics when it's off, probably won't kill you though. The big Army truck gets fried as do the guys in it and the good Dr says it fried the the battery and starter. He whips out his cute little red tool box and swaps the battery and alternator from their Jeep Liberty and the big diesel starts! Yeah, right. Apparently the biggest nuclear bombs ever made are pretty light, it only took four guys to load them into the truck, how did they get them into the Russian sub that just happened to be on the west coast? An old Russian Diesel sub can make it to the bottom of the Marianas Trench? 36,000 feet down? Really? And the guy with the pacemaker, why didn't the earlier EM pulses fry his pacemaker? These are just some of the gross abuses of reality, there are many more, don't bother unless you want something to laugh at, in disbelief.
__label__2 Really works!: 1 star because it is messy but this is AMAZING. I've used the freeze away crap and it doesn't work and is too expensive. This is cheap and will work within two uses. Make sure you wrap the area tight though!
__label__2 Success At Last!: Like many others, I struggled for MONTHS with an inconveniently located wart on my finger. I tried three (3) other kinds of retail removal products, and I was thinking that perhaps I was just out of luck. Then, I read through the reviews for this PediFix Wart STICK and was encouraged enough to try one more time. The product arrived quickly, AND MY WART FRIEND IS ALMOST GONE! Excellent.
__label__1 disappointment: After reading all the great reviews I was thinking that this stuff was really strong and going to work. I was expecting to feel a light burning sensation so I could tell that it was working. I tried using this several times and it did nothing. I don't know if I just got a bad one because it looked like it was somewhat melted when I opened it. Too me, I felt like I was putting chapstick on a wart and hoping it would work.
__label__1 Doesn't work good, very disapointed: I purchased this product due to all the great reviews. I have used this on my daughters leg for several weeks and still nothing. My daughters leg looks to be rubbed raw but there has been no progress with her warts. I am very disapointed with this medicine!!!
__label__1 terrible product: Bought this to remove a wart. Weeks later of apply several times a day...minimal results.I threw it away. What a joke. I did then buy trichloroacetic acid 50% and boom...the wart was gone.More expensive, but cheaper than buying the "freeze away" over and over.
__label__1 Not worth it.: I had a bunch of plantars warts on my heel that had been there for a while and just kept multiplying. I was under the impression that they had to be removed by a doctor, until I saw this product. I immediately ordered it and began using it religiously. A couple weeks passed and I didn't see a change in the warts. The skin around them wasn't looking so good, but the warts were still thriving. I read online that a lot of people have luck with apple cider vinegar, so I tried that. MUCH better results. Forget this product, just go to the store and get some ACV, cotton balls and duct tape.
__label__2 So far I am impressed!: Purchased this product a few weeks ago for my tween son. He started with one wart on his foot but soon others developed. Previously we were using Dr. Sch**** for several weeks and it just had a minor effect on the warts. So, after some research I decided to give Pedifix a shot. It is working very effectively so far! No pain at all when he applies it. This is my 1st review written on Amazon, but not my 1st reading of reviews. I glean a lot of info from reading and analyzing reviews. I am glad I chose this product.
__label__2 Great Item: I think this item worked excellent compared to the other liquid based removers which seem to take forever to work. My foot doctor recommended this to me and it's hard to find in local stores. It is stronger so watch you don't use too much because your skin will get irritated around the wart site. One tip my dr. gave me was to use a Q-Tip to scoop some out and then apply to the wart. That way you don't re-infect yourself! I would definately purchase this again.
__label__1 looks like chap stick: I got the wart stick for my grand daughter (11 yrs old) she has a wart on her hand and foot! but i was afraid to give it to her or my daughter because it looks just like chap stick! and my Grand daughter has a lot of little friends.so the stick is at the dump.there for i don't know if it works or not.
__label__1 With Love by Hilary Duff: This product was delivered promptly and efficiently within three days of ordering it.Don't like the scent anymore however, I don't know if I have changed or if it is an old batch.
__label__1 NOT AS MY EXPECTATION AT ALL!: I thought it's a score book, just like "The Corrs / The Corrs", but I am totally wrong.
__label__2 Building up steam...: Thefirst volume of Gasarakireally surprised me. It was well written and thoughtful, trying to tell a deep story that was more about behind the scenes power plays than robot brawls.This second disc continues to add new wrinkles and complications. The war with Belgistan comes to a close (which surprised me as I thought it was going to run through the entire series) and the JSSDF forces prepare to pull out. We learn about a secret organization calling itself Symbol that was assisting Belgistan, though their motivations for doing so are still clouded.Yushiro causes some commotion when he heads off base and winds up in the middle of a kidnapping. We also see more of the mysterious girl from the first disc that seems to share Yushiro's powers.Very little seems to happen episode by episode. If the disc is watched straight through it is very satisfying viewing, but I can see that if I were watching this half an hour at a time as it was broadcast it would have been tough to follow.
__label__2 Great classic, many unreadable subtitles: This film deserves the excellent reputation it has earned. However the version I purchased (International Film Series) has white subtitles against white backgrounds. Only about 60% are fully readable. Other releases may have the same problem. Do not buy this unless you speak French.
__label__1 Looked cool :(: I am an avid ps2 gamer. I purchased this from a local store because of its apparent convenience. Was I ever wrong. The device has a battery indicator on it with 4 bars. When the batteries go down to 3 bars, I have a very sporadic connection to my ps2 (my ps2 is only 10ft away). After a while of playing Everquest Online, this became very annoying and inconvenient. After a month, I ditched this and bought a cable extender. Another expensive lesson. :(
__label__1 BALLS EVERYWHERE!: We live in AK and so we thought we needed to find something to keep our toddler active while being cooped up during the winter. Our son loves it...WE HATE IT! It takes up almost the whole living room...that's not the bad part! There is only a bottom in the Large section. The two medium section are open on the bottom so there are always balls everywhere! We bought extra balls (which you need) but our house turns into a ball pit! But we make it a game with our toddler to pick up the balls...but WARNING you will be finding balls for days!
__label__2 not just for the over 3 crowd: Santa bought this for my then 11 month old for his first Christmas. He and his little friends just love playing in the tents and tunnells. (The cats do too.) I don't think you need to wait for age 3 as recommended. I do wish it were a bit sturdier as a couple of the ties have torn already. I highly recommend this product, especially over the winter when it is wet and dreary here--it sits in our living room for oodles of fun.
__label__2 Great Product!!: I bought this for my youngest son's third birthday. It is a great product! Both of my boys, (ages 3 and 6) love to play with it. It is a good outside or inside toy but to use it outside there can not be much wind because it is very light and will blow around easily. To use inside you do need lots of room. It can be put together or taken apart in less than 5 minutes so it is a toy you can buy even if you don't have room to always leave it up. I would recommend this toy to anyone. It would be a great toy for a baby just learning to craw.
__label__1 Flimsy and Seams Coming Apart: I think it is a hit or miss on this product. I have a friend that has a Playhut and it is fine. We just opened ours and at least 6 seams are coming undone (not sewn correctly), there are a couple holes in the material, 2 forgotten attachment loops, and it is rather flimsy. Kids still like it, though it isn't going to last too long.
__label__1 You call this a mystery?: I don't get what people like about this book. Lindsey is a fluid writer, good describer, but his characters spend way too much time in their own heads and the action, in this book at least, is predictable and rendered downright boring. All the lurid details that are supposed to add to the "psychoerotic" nature of the book come off as crude and off-putting instead, like a geek at a sideshow biting the head off a chicken. And anyone who can't guess the "surprise twist" by page 25 wasn't reading very closely.
__label__1 Disappointed!: Although David Lindsey has a talent for descriptive prose, this book overall was a big disappointment to me. He did not seem to have a clear idea how the plot would unravel, and left too many loose ends. Each time I expected a new wrinkle to develop from a piece of evidence, he didn't bother to tie it in. I think it's possible that he didn't even know how it would end until it did, and at that point he was just tired of writing. If you decide to read this book, be prepared to see very ugly things with no redeeming human value, and be prepared to be left wondering . . . "what ever happened with the ______ ?"
__label__2 Great for 18 month old and 4 year old!: My girls love this. It looks great in their little play kitchen and it is educational as well. I tried to reduce the poor quality plastic kitchen toys and use good quality products instead. The shapes are easy to put together & they look realistic.
__label__2 Lost Balls....Found?: Nice book, not quite as good as I expected but had some really awesome photos! AC
__label__2 Great toy but Hard to turn off: A review from a kid.: pro's :great fun, portable.con's: hard to read LED except in darkness ,no off button.As soon as I got this toy I started playing it.but then ,I found out that in bright light I could not see the LED so I went in some shade.Now thats just fine except theres no shade indoors!so I found a dull light and used it.But then I brushed the yesbutton and no button would turn it off so I had to play it though.But overall if you have a dull reading light and you are patient, buy this product.
__label__1 Not like the ones I've seen--not as good: Instead of being a better product, this one is made cheaper and seems flimsy and doesn't respond like the "older" versions. Aren't things supposed to get better? This one is made in China--where all the leaded paint and computer things are being messed with/sabatoged?Wish I'd gone into a store and looked at it, held it (this one is lighter & not good quality) and the color is dark (not the bright red or blue I've always used/seen) and hard to read the text, too.Would have sent it back, but for the shipping costs (which ran up the price).
__label__2 My kids & all their friends love this game!: My 7 & 9 year olds love this game - and we have gotten it for all of their friend's birthdays, too. They love trying to come up with items to stump the computer... it keeps them busy and gets them thinking.
__label__2 It's Grrrrreat!: My wife and son play the game almost everyday after dinner or at breakfast on weekends. It's fun to think of an object (20Q is not very accurate at guessing abstract things) and answer it's astute questions and it usually gets it right. Sometimes it has to go on to 25 questions though. Kind of spooky that a decent database and algorithm can fit in such a small device. Highly recommended.
__label__2 Classic, unadulterated Paul Kelly & the Coloured Girls.: This is where it all started for many Kelly fans. It's wonderful stuff--Paul's lyrics on this album are pure working class poetry. The musical style is unashamedly lusty-boy pub-band, unsynthesised (I remember when music was real....) and relentlessly cheerful. Every tune on this album is catchy, and even the dark ones are uplifting. "Dumb Things" was the anthem for pre-gen-X, post-baby-boom lost souls. Kelly has honed his lyrical ability since those early days, but his story telling has always been strong.Under the Sun is unmistakably Australian, more so than on later albums. This is particularly obvious on "Forty Miles to Saturday Night" and "To Her Door". When Kelly writes about things Australian, he gets it right. There is emotional truth in the detail here, and the music is damn good. Kelly deserves his status as an Australian working-class (anti-)hero. CB
__label__1 ...: The music on this set is fine, as Ms Day always is. However it has a quirk I find distasteful. On the third cd is a hidden track, track 13 to be exact that throws all the songs out of sequence if you rip it. I wouldn't recommend buying this for that reason alone. All the songs are available on other cd's so it's no problem skipping over this one. It seems if they want to mess with people and keep it a secret until after the money is spent then my money will be spent elsewhere.
__label__1 Nice instight hidden in the pages: The book is not bad. The most valuable sections of this book include topics of Structure-Process-Outcome (sometimes), cognitive learning, values, culture, goals, working with tools, and communication. The diagrams and tables in this book are almost not helpful at all; sometimes you wonder if diagrams like figure 1-3 on page 23 is downright necessary to have there. I felt like parts four and five of the book really dragged on unnecessarily, especially the chapter on organizational engineering. It seemed as if the book completely broke down and lost it after page 300. I think that Hoemann had a lot of potential in this book when I first saw it, and I was let down. Another nice thing would be for him to drop the plethora of coined-terms. Overall, there is some really nice thoughts in here, but there is a lot of unnecessary things that you have to thumb through.
__label__1 Too much money for too few channels: This antenna may work for some people, but for me it was another regrettable purchase. The assembly is fairly easy, but the results proved a letdown. I bought the Terk in hopes it would work perfectly with the Samsung DTB-H260F set top box I am using to bring in free OTA digital and HD stations. But I tried two different positions with the Terk and its 10db amp was only able to bring in three or four local DT stations at best. Analog reception proved even worse. When I took off the Terk and replaced it with a coventionally-designed, less expensive indoor antenna with a 45db amp in those same positions, the difference in performance was amazing...I could get between 12 and 15 DT channels. In conclusion, my advice is to avoid the hype about unusual antenna design and go for maximum decibel amplification. It's that extra power that made the difference for me. Sorry Terk...
__label__2 Best Book on VB.NET I've Found: This is far and away the best book I've found on VB.NET. It is well written, and offers excellent perspective on VB.NET and .NET Framework, with enough detail so that the reader (together with some hands-on experience) will have a good depth of knowledge when he's finished. Highly recommended!
__label__1 Obfuscation of even the most trivial slices of code: Bought the book over a month ago and totally disagree with a lot of the reviews online; book is almost totally unreadable as it takes even the most simple pieces of code and over complicates them to the point where you just end up closing the cover and say what a waste of money.
__label__2 Great cookbook: I purchased this book for my husband who worked for a couple of weeks in Trinidad. He was not able to buy a cookbook while there.I searched Amazon and bought the one and only Trindad cookbook, and it was a winner! He was very pleased that the recipes were for a lot of the food that he experienced.
__label__2 One of the best books of all time: This book is an amazing story of a young girl growing up in poverty in New York City. The vividness of the images, the developing of the characters, Betty Smith is a master at her art. Francie and her family come alive in this book. I've read it over and over and I still love it. I would recommend it for anyone from high level 4th grade readers to elderly people. What an amazing story!
__label__2 touching: A Tree Grows in Brooklyn , is a very touching novel. It takes place in the 1920's and tells what life is like growing up back then , with all of the obstacles that come along the way. Francis is the main character of the book who grows up along with the trees in Brooklyn.She grows up in a poor family and struggles to fit in and find friends however, that does not bring her down. Francis is still a very happy and cheerful person regardless of what other people may try to tell her. She loves to read and since she doesn't have many friends, she feels and makes her books her friends. When Betty Smith wrote this book, she looked back on her life and the experiences she had, and put some of them in her book. It is written not only for teenagers or adults, but anyone who wants to read about the thrill of growing up. If you miss A Tree Grows In Brooklyn you are missing a truly great novel.
__label__2 An Awsome book that you must read!: Francie is a girl who is dirt poor, and living in Brooklyn during harsh times. Francie is strong through the horrible things that happen to her during the course of her life. I cried, I laughed, and I felt the pain that Francie felt. Francie also deals with the tradgedy of her fathers death. Not to mention almost being raped. This book also deals with a girl becoming a woman. A must read book!!!!!
__label__2 Three Thumbs Up!: I give this book three thumbs up! It is poinent, funny, sad, romantic, and scary all at the same time! It is a classic that will keep readers on their toes for a million years!
__label__2 Fantastic reading: I have read " A Tree Grows In Brooklyn" over and over again.When things in my own life seem too difficult,I read about the life of Francie Nolan and realize I can overcome any problem with the same determination that Francie and her family had. All the characters were good,from the strong-willed mother,the weak dreamer of a father, to the loving but promiscuous aunt. Francie was my favorite character of all,she was able to overcome the adversity in her life through sheer dtermination and the gift of learning. She learned from everyone around her and the harsh enviroment in which she lived. I would recommend this book anyone who likes coming of age stories.I have read "A Tree GrowsI have read "A Tree GrowsI have read "A Tree Growsin
__label__2 It's not hype!: This book has so many pearls of wisdom. It's very simply written, so do not expect this to be a typical NYT bestseller like the one you read last week. I believe this book was written in the '40s, and although much of the vernacular in the book is obviously of a different period in time, it has a timeless and universal appeal. I haven't even finished it yet, but have already decided, enough with the library version, I want my own copy so that I can use the advice it offers later on in life. Don't miss this one, and make sure you tell your friends about it, so that they can come and thank you later, and you can say "I told you so".
__label__1 A (Diseased) Tree Grows in Brooklyn: I recently read this book for my English class at school. I have enjoyed every other book we have been required to read; however, I strongly disliked this book. From the first chapter I lost interest in the ornate, seemingly endless details. On several occasions I noted incorrect grammar in the book, and even misspellings! Never before have I seen such a poorly written book. I do not recommend this book. I would not call this book a classic.
__label__2 Saw the: movie MANY years ago. Loved it then and loved the story as I read it. Times were tough by our standards but attitudes were good and mostly positive. Good read.
__label__1 A Classic?: I honestly don't know how this novel has become a classic. As an avid reader I had to practically force myself to get through this book and only did so because my book club was reading it. I wasn't the only person in our club who was disappointed. It was a miserable story and pointless. It was a great discription of life in Brooklyn during that time period but Betty Smith never made me care about the characters enough to care about what happened to them. This novel needs more character development to be a classic. I only give it 2 stars instead of 1 because it really is a great description of life in Brooklyn.
__label__2 A Lifetime Favorite: My Mom gave me this book to read when I was very young. Actually I have one of the first publications of it. I have read this book a number of times over the years and never get tired of the characters and the story. Reminds us that recycling actually did begin a long time ago when during the depression kids would take wagons full of things to recycle to get pennies for bread. A beautiful story I will read again and again. So happy to have it on my Kindle now.
__label__2 Great book, good condition: Loved the book! Read it in 5 days. The condition was as advertised by the seller. Would recommend it to other people.
__label__1 Credit Cards Will Not Fit: All the credit card slots are to small for credit cards. I had to cut each side of the slots to get the cards to fit.
__label__2 It's both gorgeous and a good read: This has been my favorite book now for a couple of months, and I finally had to write a review that disagrees with the previous negative ones. There's no nice way to say this, but maybe there is a new money-old money difference in perception here. What I see in the book is one gorgeous and highly livable room after another. Lively, vibrant, personal and comfortable homes obviously used by real people. What I didn't expect was that I would pick up as many decorating ideas for my own home as I did.
__label__1 Dissappointing at Best: The book does not live up to Traditional Home's reputation of quality work. Frankly, I can find better photos and design insite from magazines than what I found in this book. It's easy to understand why there are so many people wanting to sell the copies they have. It is honestly a disppointment if you are used to truly inspiring design publications. If you decide to buy this book, do yourself a favor and purchase a used copy. Even at Amazon's reduced price it's still over priced for what you get.
__label__2 A Story Everyone Must Know...: Secret of the Wild Child tells the compelling story of Susan Wiley, a young girl who was rescued from a dysfunctional home during the 1970s by a system that ultimately failed her. Nova explores her journey from Hell to Limbo in an unforgettable documentary that shows the darkest sides of humanity and the captivating innocence of a child. You too will be haunted by this beautiful girl whom everybody simply referred to as Genie.I would so love to own a copy of this DVD!
__label__2 Well Worth Acquiring!: Pianist John Hicks has long been a master of the modern mainstream without necessarily blazing any new paths of his own. On this CD he is featured on a pair of solo numbers, a duet with flutist Elise Wood (a sensitive version of Duke Ellington's "Star Crossed Lovers"), a trio rendition (with bassist Curtis Lundy and drummer Cecil Brooks III.) of "Mood Swings," with a quintet (a blazing version of "My Shining Hour" that has both Bobby Watson and Vincent Herring on altos) and five selections with the full sextet. Four standards follow six obscurities (including Charles Mingus' "Diane"). Hicks, who often shows off the influence of McCoy Tyner's voicings, has never recorded an uninspired record and this one is better than average for him. Due to the variety of moods, instrumental colors and settings, the music is continually interesting and well worth acquiring.
__label__2 "Conversation" video: I bought this video for the "Conversation" video where Waylon Jennings and Hank Williams Jr. are playing their guitars, singing, and sharing whisky. I like when they raise their whisky glasses to each other. This is a comical, well put together video with Robert Duvall. I like the 3 videos that tied together like a mini-movie... EVERY WALON JENNINGS FAN SHOULD OWN THIS GREAT VIDEO!...
__label__1 Not What I Expected: I looked forward to this celebration CD very eagerly. However, the disappointment was great other than Gretchen Davis. I've been a fan of Kristofferson for 35-40 years and that could be the problem. There are very few people who can sing his songs - Johnny, Waylon, Willie, and Kris. I far preferred and really love the "This Old Road" CD.Donna
__label__1 How did Brian Mcknight and Russell Crowe get on this CD: I couldnt wait to hear this CD cause i love Kris Kristofferson and his work. many of the names on the CD were great and some great singers came out to do triButes to Kristofferson. Shooter Jenning's "Silver Tongue Devil and I" is amazing. Willie Nelson's "The Legend" is as great or if not better then the Highwaymen version. The version on "Why Me" is also a worthy tribute. The problem i had with the CD was when i heard Russell Crowe's "Darby's Castle" cause it was a horrible redition where Russell Crowe tries and fails at doing the talking blues that was done so well by Kristofferson and Dylan. Then i heard the awful Brian Mcknight atrocity "Me and Bobby Magee" which was just Mcknight turning a country and rock classic into his horrible R&B redition. I had never heard a bad version of "Me and Bobby Magee" until this CD. I don't know how those two got on this CD but fans of Kristofferson should be enraged.
__label__2 Hooray for Doris!: These two albums have been (thankfully) put on one CD. Doris is at her best here, particularly with sassy renditions of "Cheek to Cheek" and "Easy to Love." The title song, with its slow beginning to its jazzy ending, is sung by Doris in an ironic and humorous manner; even the composer admits that her rendition of "Horray for Hollywood" is the best version by any singer. On Volume 2, she sings wistfully of "It Might As Well Be Spring" and "Three Coins in the Fountain" as well sings coyly "Nice Work If You Can Get It" and "I've Got My Love to Keep Me Warm." Also, "Over the Rainbow" and "Blues in the Night" are stand-outs.
__label__1 Strangely compelling, but not really all that great: I gave this book two stars because of its original approach to an old idea. The zombies in this book (called "bodies." The z word is never used.) were different enough to draw my attention.Unfortunately, that is really all this book had going for it. The author failed to show me any reason to be afraid of these bodies. I was told over and over that the survivors were afraid, but I saw no compelling reason for that.If you do decide to try this book, because of all the (wtf) 4+ reviews everywhere, I recommend you (a) get it from the library and (b) stop at book one.
__label__1 Save your money, don't buy this dryer.: I bought this dryer on October 15, received it on October 23 and on November 9 the plug started to overheat and burn after 5 minutes of use. The settings at which the plug started to smoke were: medium speed and hot temperature. Also, I did not use it daily... as you can see nothing too harsh or unexpected for a hair dryer. I am returning it to Amazon ASAP and hope I can get my money back. I don't want a replacement... one bad experience is enough for me. Just as a hint if you are thinking of buying a Vidal Sassoon dryer: If their products have so many negative reviews and unsatisfied costumers it is not a coincidence, obviously the Vidal Sasson brand has serious quality management issues. I thought about this, but went an bought this dryer any way. I was a sucker for the price and free shipping I should have just gone with my initial mistrust and bought something else. I hope this does not happen to you.
__label__2 Really good miniseries, but Amazon let me down: I bought this from Amazon in July. Unfortunately, I only opened it last week to find out it was a defective on the first disk. It played the first and third episodes perfectly but the second episode had 20 minutes of skipping. Amazon has absolutely no way of reporting this after your window of return has expired. So buyer beware. If you are slow to view your DVD's you can be screwed. I have always had good luck with Amazon until now.The series is excellent and quite intriguing until the end. I enjoyed it despite the skipping in the middle.
__label__2 A necessary if unpleasant reading experience: Rating this one is difficult. The rich symbolism of Tarot was forever impacted by the Order of the Golden Dawn, and A.E. Waite's "Pictorial Key" is a glimpse into that symbolism. Readers with a serious interest in occult Tarot will find this an essential text. Waite, though, considered himself bound by vows of secrecy, and mixes misinformation and blinds in his work to lead the "uninitiated" astray, so reading critically is a must. To make matters worse, his prose style is ponderous and leaden, deliberately overcomplicated and abstruse, less animated than Al Gore. However, modern tarot decks borrow and adapt from the Waite-Smith deck design; to understand the symbolism that underlies almost every deck on the market today (frequently symbolism the deck designers had no awareness of), this book is absolutely necessary. It won't be a fun read, but it *is* necessary
__label__2 Excelent: This is the second time I bought the same book from Stamatis.The first one I gave to one friend. He push me do give it as a gift.This second edition is far better.
__label__1 every since i saw one on tv: every since i have seen on on tv i been scared.it's sounds wierd too.i don't like the music maker.get an idog
__label__2 Good System: I've used the Voice Alert System for about a month now. It works good but does false trigger some. I've tried moving the sensor and adjusting the sensivitity and it has helped. I may just need to tweak it a little more. It has never failed to trigger when someone has entered the area, which is the important part. I don't know that I would hook it to a siren but I'm very happy with the system. Instructions that come with the unit are very good but where a little unclear about how to hook up the external devices to be trigged. I plan to add a light to be activialed in the warehouse for night. I did buy an extra sensor for the driveway and some of the false alerts there are casued by birds flying in front of the sensor. It's a good 120' away and the base unit is inside a brick building in an interior room (2 walls). It picks up all traffic in the drive. Good system for the money.
__label__1 Voice alert system 6: I am sorry that I ever bought this thing, it is the most annoying "toy" I have ever bought. No matter where I put it or how I adjust it, it goes off all night long. This would be a great gadget in theory if we lived in an animal free (No squirrels) and bug free (no flying beetles, moths & etc.) world but seeing how that is not the case, it's really not good for anyone. Even the shadows of people and cars set this thing off. I thank god that I didn't buy two alert systems as I originally planned.
__label__2 Great Puzzle: Although it took a long time to receive this puzzle, it was worth the wait. My kids love trying to figure out how to maneuver the vehicles to get them to a building. I would recommend this for children over 2. It takes a lot of fine motor coordination to move the vehicles.
__label__1 Too much sex!: Have read all the books published to date. Loved the plots and story lines. Finally through them all out (Yep, tossed one paperback and two hardcopy) as I realized as I was re-reading them, that the somewhat graphic sex (Dominance and Submission, and Harem Girls, etc) didn't really add to the story but sure promoted things I just don't like. The March Upcountry series with David Weber had boys and girls, and talked about sex, but was what I consider more normal for SciFi, and was not graphic, did not promote "alternative" sex. So while I enjoy the James Bond nature of the novels, I really can't recommend them to any of my friends, and wouldn't recommend them to anyone younger.
__label__2 First prize.: This book has found a permanent spot in my home, namely, on my desk, where I do all my hobbies. It has loads of great ideas that I've already used. Can't wait for the author's next book --apparantly its a sourcebook on animal designs.
__label__1 Do Not Buy: This item did not work and it just irritates your skin. You think it works because you see your skin being irritated and think that it's the product doing its job but it doesn't work. Not only was this way more expensive than the other corn sticks but it also was a waste of my money.
__label__1 a total rip if you own "Music has the right to children": If you already own "Music has the right to children" and you are itching for more BoC like I was then just take a deep breath and be content with "Music.." becasue this cd is a money making scheme just about. All the songs on it are the same ones, there is no re-mixing at all. But, there is one exception at the end they play a 2 minute bit that gets you excited but then ends. This is hardly worth 12.99 so looks like you and me are gonna have to wait until BoC makes a new album. Awwwwwwwww hurry up guys!
__label__1 Violence Bonjour?: How many graphically described violently mutilated corpses do they think it takes to sell a book? Having rather enjoyed Deja Dead (the genre of lady pathologists seems to be the flavour of the month), I just couldn't finish Death du Jour. I found it a rehash of the other with more blood and gore added and even some sex - wowee! It made me long for a good old romantic historical novel - where have they gone?
__label__2 Watch Out for Those Bones: Forensic pathologist Temp Brennan spends part of each year in North Carolina and part of it in Quebec -- investigating death. Usually her investigations find her examining bodies and bones of historical deaths or of recent deaths where normal means of pathological investigation aren't effective. Author Kathy Reichs clearly knows her pathology. Herself a practitioner, she makes her field exciting for the reader to learn about. In addition her character Temp Brennan finds herself in the midst of people who's deaths have been quite mysterious. Death Du Jour travels from uncovering the hundred year old remains of a nun who is believed to be a Saint to the sleaziness of a cult who might just be killing people as part of their worship. Temp Brennan isn't just a laboratory investigator. She is indeed one solid pathologist who is not particularly willing to let a case close without getting to the bottom of it. A fascinating world and a well told mystery.
__label__1 Dull, flat writing kills the fun: Gore yes, lots of information about autopsies and assorted other matters, rather too-clearly-fictitious characters ... It all adds up to a rather flat, dispiriting formula effort. If you just HAVE to know who's responsible every time you read of a fictitious killing, then you'll get through this, otherwise it becomes rather a drag.
__label__1 Awful!: This book was boring and poorly written. The plot was weak and obvious, but worse than that, the writing was simplistic and choppy- very hard to read. I always finish books that I start and this one I almost put down. I only finished it, by skimming because the reading was so choppy, because I had already bought it and couldn't return it. No character development, no characterization of the characters at all, and the dialogue is flat and boring and only serves to advance plot. Descriptions don't describe-they tell in short sentances, or they lecture. I'm a scientist and I found this book boring and annoying!This is my second Reichs novel. The other was better, but I won't be coming back. Save your money and your time!
__label__1 What is your definition of good?: Readable and missing no pages? Wow! I was in the book business a long time and this paperback I received was not in "good condition:" it was dog-eared, had water damage and cover damage. Good thing it was only a paperback and quite cheap. Paperbacks were essentially intended to be like the newspaper, read and discarded. This one, perhaps not discard in this day and age, but definitely not resold. Like I said, good thing a paperback and my "Author Du Jour," because otherwise I would have been p*****. However, it did arrive in record time: 2 days, I think.
__label__2 Good, but...: I really liked this book and I love the main character of Tempe Brennan. The characters are well drawn and multi-dimensional and I loved all of the tidbits about forensics and anthropology. The locations were rich in detail and I felt like I was there. My only complaint about this book was that I had every single plot point figured out a good 30-50 pages before Tempe did. There wasn't a single thing in this book that surprised me. But it was still an enjoyable read and even if I knew that going in, I would still read it.
__label__2 Holy Grail Found!: I've been after the vinyl for these two albums for 10+ years....it is considered the holy grail of west coast (USA) psychedelia. I gave up and bought the CDs through Amazon. Better than I thought. An absolute classic and equal to the reputation. Years ahead of its time but yet perfect for the summer of love generation. Everyone I have played it to are equally high in praise.
__label__2 Too much is not enough: My boys, ages 5 and 7, can't get their fill of this colorful, wacky book. The love indulging their imaginations with it each night before bed and "sweet thirds and fourths" of it in a single sitting would not be enough if they had their way!
__label__2 A good collection: I 've always liked this release for the following tracks: Ghosts of Cape Horn and Make Way for The Lady. The others are fine too with the sole clunker being the wretched The Auctioneer which is so out of place here. If I want to hear that nonsense, I'll go to a cattle auction. Originally a digital recording, it suffered from tape hiss which is odd for digital(the early days of)recording. The hiss is gone but the recording still doesn't sound right to my ears particularly the vocals. Suprisingly, this is a very short disc clocking in at a paltry 33.50. Another entire release could have easiliy fit on the remainder of the disc. I hate when labels cheat the consumer in that fashion. So be it, still worthwhile for some very good tracks. 10 tracks/full lyrics/33.50.
__label__2 Dreaming of more...: Gordon didn't have a 'good experience' while recording this one...yet, it's classic Lightfoot...Dream Street should have been one of his biggest sellers.
__label__2 Vivid descriptions and fast moving plot: Although it has been some time since I read this story, its vivid descriptions have stayed with me. The author does a marvelous job of describing the Southern California beach city setting, so much so that while driving on Sepulvida two months ago, I saw a drab three-story stucco commercial building and simply knew that it must be the building that houses the call-center. Also typically Southern Californian, the car chase contained endless minutes at a jam-packed intersection with the driver cursing himself for chosing the wrong route.Overall, Hotline is an entertaining story that keeps the pages turning.
__label__1 TERRIBLE!!: I have never entered a review before, but this book was so bad I had to stop you from wasting your time. I tried to enter a 0 rating but I guess 1star is as low as you can go. The reviews were mixed, but I bought this book anyway because I run a call center and I thought perhaps that would make it more interesting for me. Total waste of time, can't believe that the type A in me wouldn't just let me quit half way through. I kept thinking the "real" storyline was yet to be introduced, or maybe some interesting plot twist was coming. Boring characters, unrealistic scenarios. I will never read another book by this author.
__label__2 THE BOOK IS AN EXCELLENT ENDING. . . OR IS IT?!: This book is ultra-rare, so if you can get a copy, keep it. I stole mine from the public library. The book visits some of the old Spacer worlds from the Robot novels, and it is interesting to see how time has treated them. This book also provides incite into the WHOLE Foundation series! THIS IS A MUST!!!!!
__label__1 Too much: This book has too much of everything... except action.There isn't much of a story and it's way too long.There's a lot of endless talk about the same subjectsand lots more sex than any other Asimov book. Theother Foundation books were fine for all ages. This onehas way too much adult content. I think that 300 pagescould easily have been cut out. In fact, to get to thereal story, just skip to the last 40 pages. Boring.Long. It dishonors the enitre series.
__label__2 asimov is a genius.: Anyone who hasn't read about Hari Seldon and Psychohistory needs to. Though it's a fictional science in the book, I wouldn't be suprised if someone wasn't studying it today. Asimov's writing is compelling ... not too full of sci-fi babble which often sounds odd to readers 40 years later, and that makes it pretty timeless. Many older books constantly irritate me in this manner.
__label__1 Another one...: ...of those bands whose latest work disappoints me. If like me, you were expecting more 'sorry about tomorrow' then steer clear. This just wasn't *ahem* 'rocking' enough for my tastes - and felt like a real step backwards (contrary to the other reviews) I don't think they will return to their higher energy material, which for me is a shame, as I was a fan.
__label__2 one of the greatest TPB's of all time: If you like comic book deities even a slight bit, or even modern or ancient human deities, then this book is for you. Struggles are all of cosmic proportion. I love the reference to all Earth's ancient religion gods as gods who are but a drop in the bucket compared to some of the forces at work here. Even though its a comic book, it tells it like it is. Us, as human beings, can lay no claim to even comprehend the magnitude and sheer myriad of benevolent and malevolent forces that constantly struggle on planes of existence much higher than ours or any of our perceived gods. Religious zealots would do good to read this book and give them a better understanding of how small their religious texts are in the grand scheme of things.
__label__2 Great story, I am enjoying it: I have always been intriqued with guys like Thanos, Apocalypse, Galactus and so on. These is a great story about the mad power hungry thanos and the super heroes who have to stop him. I learn alot of things I did not know of Thanos. I have yet to finish reading the book, I am halfway there but I have to say I have loved it. I am not that big of a comics collector but I decided to buy this and I must say its a great read.
__label__2 This deserves to be an Animated Movie.: I had already read this story before I got the compilation version. Thanos is by far one of the best villians I have ever read about. He appears to be a villian but from his point of view, he doesnt really see a good or bad in anything. The action is great and does make sense in the marvel universe. This story is meant for animation and would easily be on a higher level then the previous cartoon movies that have been released. The story of thanos getting the infinity gems is just as much fun as seeing him use them to mess with everyone including the cosmic beings.
__label__2 A Collector's Review: An Awesome book because it is full of many heroes and many villians in the marvel universe.
__label__1 a patchwork, not a book: The authors have taken the opportunity to publish a book of which they wrote only a small portion. The plot progresses through the snippets of first-time writers. This book is not a part of the series but an attempt to milk the series for all it's worth. (See also Grantville Gazette I,II, III).Instead of a cogent style, the book is pieced together from snippets available elsewhere. As a result the book fails to tell a cogent story, forcing the reader to parse disparate language and editorial differences from section to section.
__label__1 Worst in the series thus far.: By far this is the worst book in the series. Maybe five pages worth of rebellion or plot development, 200 pages of dry political education, and 100 pages on ballet recitals. Dry and pointless reading.
__label__1 Disappointing After the Really Great Work in 1632 and 1633: I discovered Eric Flint's work when a friend loaned me 1632. I had not read much speculative fiction other than some Harry Turtledove and I have to say I loved it. Then I went out and bought 1633, it was another gem. Things skipped a bit with The Galileo Affair, just a little too much sermonizing. But this latest, The Ram Rebellion, just stinks. Most of the stories were written by obvious amateurs fascinated with sheep, cooking, agriculture and whatnot. Now those are all fine things, but I bought the other books to be entertained with action+fantasy+history, in that order, not history+agribusiness+feminism. I am going to read one more book in this series and if it does not improve I will swear it off for good.
__label__1 Not so much: I was very disappointed with this ring. I plan on returning it. Looks nothing like the picture. I would have been better off buying something similar at the teen jewelry store at the local mall. Totally over priced not worth it at all.
__label__1 I agree...just recieved today: This ring looks nothing like the picture. the diamonds are small and not very noticeable; I will be sending this back
__label__2 Sterling Silver Cubic Zirconia Eternity Ring: I was looking for a small silver ring and this one was perfect. It exceeded my expections because the ring was not expensive at all. It is true to size and if you want a ring that sparkles quite a bit this one is it.Mrs. Mayville
__label__2 I love this simple band: I wanted a pretty band with sparkle cause I hate to have a raised up stone with little ones for the scratching. But this ring is perfect. Smooth and shiny.
__label__2 Decent: After having a lot of trouble finding a wedding band for my small ring finger, I decided on this one. This is the 4th ring I've tried. It fits nicely and looks fine with my small diamond solitaire. Has a good amount of sparkle but definitely doesn't look expensive. Don't let anyone look too closely!
__label__2 Back to the Movies: This product was handled and packaged fast, easy to open. Was very happy to fined this old movie to enjoy over and over again.
__label__1 Worthless: This stuff is a ripoff. I found some at a local store and bought it just to see if it amounted to anything. It does not. Go to the store and buy a 24oz bottle of cheap body wash and a 2oz vial of tea tree oil. Empty 2oz from body wash and then pour tea tree oil in. Shake well. Same thing only MUCH stronger and a fraction of the cost.
__label__1 Dangerous!: Be prudent. It is a dangerous concoction. The fumes can give a soar throat, swollen glands, and you might not get the smell out of your nose for a few days. It needs warning labels, and testing.
__label__1 Disappointed: I developed white spots on my legs after using a tanning bed. This product had GREAT reviews eliminating the appearance of these white spots. Unfortunately it did nothing for me.
__label__2 starblazers goood: i just picked up the dvd of the first 5 episodes and must say that the vhs version {by jupiter} was much smoother and cleaner than this {dvd} version. however this is better than nothing as stated by others and my wife who has been a fan for nigh on 25 years now. so if you must have your starblazers as my wife does then definitely pick this up.AND SEND IN YOUR CARDS.
__label__1 America is Going Deaf: I find it very hard to understand how anyone could listen to this music, as a vivd music listener and an open minded one at that, this music was the most horrid bit of sound I have ever heard. People need to stop and remember what real talent is, not this uncoordinated, bad singing group. Their music is as is they are making up the guitar riffs as they go, and I don't find it difficult to scream. So Glassjaw if your ever in need of a new screamer, I'm your man.
__label__1 The worst band ever: I've seen this band 2 times and believe me both times I wish they wernt on the bill. They are by far the worst band ever and if you like them you should be kicked in the head until theres nothing left of you. Seeing them live is like being kicked in the head anyway.
__label__2 it DEFINATELY grows on you: at first listen, i was only impressed by cosmopolitan blood loss. but after listening to the whole cd a few times in my friends car i realized that this album had a lot more depth than i gave it credit for. in my opinion some of the stand out songs on this record are ape dos mil and cosmo blood loss. but each song has something to offer. you're not just going to get an annoying flow of screams throughout each song. there's a nice variance between the deep screaming and the switch to passionate singing which makes each song stand out. i would definately grab this album if you're fans of finch and the used. its worth your time.
__label__2 Beyond Excellent: I seldom *ever* find a book in my school library that is worth reading. This book was impossible to put down and kept me going back for more. I'm hoping the door is open for a sequel, which I'd buy right away.
__label__1 The Transall Saga: The Transall SagaBy George MickcloudMark is a normal teenager who lives to be out in the wilderness. Mark goes on a solo camping trip through the desert when finds a strange blue light that when he touched it. It transported him to another planet and time. Now he must us every nature skill he ever learned to survive. Two years past and is now a strong dark colored man. One day he fined s a village under attack by an evil ruler he joins the fight and saves the king of the village and is made second in command for his bravery he is now part of this village and is starting to think that he wants to give up looking for the blue light a stay with his new family. But some people don't like Mark and want him to leave. Mark now has a price on his head for his death. Mark and his new family will fight for his freedom or die trying. Will Mark survive the war to go on to find the light or die defending his new life and family?
__label__2 A Book I Actually Wanted To Read: This is a great book about a thirteen-year-old boy named Mark. Mark is hiking across the desert where he stumbles upon a mysterious light. As Mark touches it he ends up in a whole new world. Grass and plants are red and animals are different. Also there are new types of humans. Now Mark must use everything he knows to survive and to find the mysterious light to get back home.This book has a lot of action in it and it keeps you wandering the whole time. That is one of the reasons I like this book. The only thing I didn't like is the book just kind of stops at the end. It is a great book though. I can compare this book to a lot of books Will Hobbs writes because they both have a lot of action. I could also compare this book to any survival books because Mark has to survive. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes Will Hobbs or loves action and adventure!
__label__2 A Great Book: I was assigned to review this book in class for my literature final. I am not a big reader so I was upset about haveing to read. The day after I got the book I got sick and had to stay home from school. To pass the time I sat out in the sun and read the whole book in two hours. This book was exciting and although it was slow at first, when the story got going, I couldn't stop reading. The key character is Mark a young boy who is into hiking. His parents let him go on a hike in a desert and he promises to meet them at the other end of the desert. While Mark is setting up camp one night he sees a wierd blue light. He climes closer to it and falls into it. When Mark wakes up he is in a red jungle. He goes through a sieries of troubles such as quick sand and finding food before he finds other humans. Mark finds some great compainions and a great adventure!
__label__2 James Lee Burke-Dave Robichaeux series: This is a blanket review of all 17 books in this series, the first being The Neon Rain. JLB is the definitive of Mystery/Crime writers when he developed the character Dave Robichaeux, a Cajun Homicide detective who started his career in New Orleans and eventually semi retired in New Iberia, LA. The stories are strong, sensitive, moral and above that hypnotic in a sense where you are in the story literally (if your hooked on it). Highly recommended along with his other series of books.
__label__1 Not worth the price: I expected this to be a large book like the other Good Old Days books that I bought. It is only 16 pages. I do not blame the seller. I was stupid for not checking it out before I bought it.
__label__2 Robin Trower - Putting It Straight: 1977 - Polydor RecordsSongs Include :Life In LondonGettin' BettaRunnin' From The FutureIt Ain't What It SeemsOff Beat RideLovin' YouDedicationSpeakeasy
__label__2 brings out the romantic in me: These are the romantic songs I grew up with and that is why I bought this CD. If you need a "shot" in the romance department, one or more of these songs should do it.
__label__2 My new FAVORITE FACE WASH!: The title says it all! This is hands down the best face wash I've ever encountered. Light, mildly fragrant, and deep cleansing. It leaves your skin feeling smooth and moisturized.
__label__2 Great Whodunnit!: A classic mystery with plot twists throughout to keep you guessing. Watch for a spell-binding cameo by Stephen Herbster, virtually buried in the credits but more than worthy of praise.
__label__1 Sloppy research: Although Desjardins' book contains a number of interesting revelations, his arguments are often compromised by sloppy research. For example, his key claim that "Little Round Top" was not known by that name until "years" after the battle was proven false nearly a decade ago. Desjardin is especially weak when he tries to play photo-detective. He mentions with praise the research of photo historian William Frassanito, but doesn't seem to have actually read Frassanito's books very carefully. Desjardin's arguments also suffer from the obvious omission of pertinent, but contrary information
__label__2 love it... she's wonderful...: Ít's one of the best books I've ever read. Was forced to read it for school so my expektations were the lowest ever... She's a very strong women and I like the way she gets what she wants. She's not afraid to make a sacrifice or two to have things her way, though I don't like the way she abandonnes her children all the time...
__label__2 Love these diapers - they don't leak!: Okay, the title says it all - these diapers just don't leak for larger babies. I love them and use them exclusively for our child at night (he's trained during the day) and have no problems whatsoever. They're a snap to put on and just are wonderful to use. I can't recommend these enough - I've tried so many brands and these definitely work the best. I have broken too many fingernails changing crib sheets from the results of cheap leaky diapers and so therefore, I highly recommend these diapers, and so do my nails!
__label__1 WHY DO WRITERS DO THIS??: This is an okay book in terms of the man's life (most info is culled from other sources) but when it comes to Denzel Washington's career the author commits an unpardonable sin. He writes way too much about each individual film the actor's made up to the time of the book's publication and then gives away the ending to each and every one of them!UNACCEPTABLE!!!!
__label__2 This book is wild, wonderful, blatantly honest and necessary: If I were stranded on a deserted island and could have one book with me, I would choose this one. It angers me, saddens me, offends me, and elates me. But most of all it inspires me. Each time I read it I uncover something precious and unique. It never grows old. If you truly love all that is convenient and commercialized, if you revel in the gifts technology brings you, don't read it. It's too good for you. If you truly love and are capable of appreciating the serene beauty of the wilderness buy it, read it, then cry. For it's all gone. When you read, read beneath the text. Read deeply into the subtext of this book. It's all about surfaces. Abbey proves that we cannot truly see, experience or appreciate anything unless we can look below the surface as he did.
__label__2 Buy this book...if you love nature.: Mr. Abbey has filled this book with many thoughtful observations of the desert, and life in general. This book should be mandatory reading for any present day backpacker or outdoorsman.
__label__2 Sums up my innermost feelings: I can't rave about this book enough, It was required reading for a literature of the outdoors class I took in college a decade ago and I've probably read it 20+ times since then. My copy is tattered, highlighted and written all over. Growing up in rural Utah I feel Abbey's pain towards the paving and developing of these beautiful areas. I crave the solitude that he writes about, understand the attachment towards random small creatures and can't help but laugh and nod my head in agreement at his rants. Anyone who spends time in pristine wilderness, redrock desert or not, will appreciate this read.
__label__2 Nice: For what it is (an inexpensive tp holder), it performs great. Have had other brands, and it is built as good as any.
__label__1 Bring the old type back: At least with the old type you could hook a water hose to the outlet side and attach a sprinkler to it and not have to drag a hose up and down your garden roes knocking plants
__label__1 I have three of these things--none of which work.: I am an old lady who doesn't throw anything away, thinking I might need it some day. Over the years, I've purchased three of Stern's sprayers, with high hopes that the newest one will finally work. Forget it. I'm finally dumping my hope and throwing them out. It's hard to believe that a functional one hasn't been designed.
__label__1 Lazy reproduction of an old book.: Maybe this book is out of copyright or something... but this printing is a grossly lazy reproduction of the original printing. It's actually a copy of the pages - not even fit right to the book's size. They didn't bother to transcribe and properly typeset the text using a modern system, so you're basically paying for a very rough, poorly scaled photocopy of the old printing. No wonder it's not available on Kindle.
__label__2 An Elric novel written by Authors who grew up reading Elric: I have read every Elric novel. I own 500 kilos of fantasy paperbacks. This book brought me as much joy, inspiration and satisfaction as any book I have ever read. Elric was the first "evil" hero. Every fantasy writer has taken a peice of elric to produce their characters. Drizt Do'urden is a shadow of Elric. Raistlen is almost an exact copy of Elric. Darth vader's sinister life, dependence on technology/sorcery and eventual noble self sacrifice are in mimicry of Elric. In this book so many authors who wanted to write Elric stories, some who had made great fame and fortune copying Moorcock, were given licence to write as they pleased. Every short story in the book is its authors best work because as they write about their own dark heros in their own novels they are thinking about Elric. My highest praise: I want a sequel.. or two... or ten... a series published monthly untill I am old and grey.
__label__2 fantastic pix of TEXAS: Beautiful pictures... excellent photographs If you want ton see Texas this book is it......
__label__1 Pure Dissappointment: I am sorry but this album was not what I was hoping it would be. I purchased it as a child and own it now as an adult. However, the only reason I do own it was because they attached their videos on DVD. We like it (Wild & Loose) and Juicy Gothca Krazy are great songs but only in there video forms. If you are looking for those sames songs as released on video on CD you aren't going to find it. Sad to say but I feel the only reason this album really sold was because many saw the videos first and then purchased the album hoping to hear the same thing.
__label__1 Trouble: We have trouble with the electric anchor, The cord tends to backlash and ties itself all around the wheel. so far it has been a battle. Nothing like we expected. If I could I would return it. Great idea not such a great thing.
__label__1 Im with Jim: The pedals fell off, the seats broke off. The bikes looked great and we we're psyched about them, easy to put together, nice fat tires for our play yard, but in a matter of weeks they were unuseable and off to the bike repair shop. Not a good deal at all!
__label__1 Boring: The problem with this book, is that you cannot argue for copyrights on one hand, and against them on the other. Either there is intellectual property or there is not. If there is not, then it is a government granted monopoly, and government granted monopolies can be shown to be less efficient then the market. As such, this means that copyrights would not do a better job at encouraging ingenuity. The thing is the book seems to talk about the philosophy of it a lot more then the reality of it.
__label__2 The most beautifuly written & illustrated book on Unicorns: This is with out a doubt the most beatifuly written & illustrated book on Unicorns ever published. Every page is a visual & mystical treasure.I reccomend it to any & all seekers of light on the subject of Unicorns.
__label__2 Relieved the fifth season was finally released!: I had bought all the DVDs up to season 4 and was dissapointed that they stopped issuing the seasons. All in al, the features are the same as the other seasons and the dvd's are a must have for any fresh prince fan!
__label__2 Hilarious!: I absolutely love the Fresh Prince, and buying this season was a great investment! I personally think Season 4 is the best, but this one is a close second. Also, Season 3 has bloopers at the end of every episode that I love, but I don't believe any of the others do...which is a little disappointing. Regardless, I will be buying Season 6 soon!
__label__1 Picture Looks Much Better Than Product: If I had opened the box before I gave the Club Champ Putt 'n Return Putting Mat as a gift, I would have returned it. Disappointed in the quality and durabiity. Would not recommend.
__label__2 An Easy Read; It's implementing the guidelines that's tough: Clear, simple, easy-to-read style. Many of the steps are obvious in retrospect. The book merely raises your awareness of the steps so you're more likely to use them
__label__1 Disappointed: Although the subject matter was interesting, the lack of pictures and overall layout of the book made it tedious to read. I saw so many opportunities for this book to be better. For example, there were many instances where an accompanying picture would have clarified a description or put it into a better context. A specific example of this is where she mentions a nail belt. It would have been illuminating to see a picture of one on that page. The writing style to me seemed dry, almost "textbook".
__label__1 Disappointing: This is a fascinating subject, but Kuhns makes too many mistakes in areas I'm familiar with for me to trust there are none in areas I'm not. Her discussion of pagan culture is muddled; she collapses together customs of different centuries as if all pagans of all places and times were interchangeable. The book also shows signs of having been spell-checked by computer.
__label__2 Very nice set especially for the money: Bought this to replace a very expensive crystal set I'd given away and like it a lot for the money. It's pretty and functional. Comes nicely packaged too. Would not hesitate to give as a gift.
__label__2 Clear and tremendously helpful!: I've been studying Arabic from a variety of sources, and this book has clarified much of the grammar I was confused about. I wouldn't recommend it for beginners, but for those who need to clarify Arabic's overwhelming grammar rules and review and organize what you may have learned in your courses, it's tremendously helpful. Its layout is simple and straightforward, and the exercises are helpful too.
__label__1 What a stinker: How did this piece of junk ever get made? Granted, I'm not a teenager, but I hope that even teenagers have brains enough to recognize a dog when they see one! The only reason I viewed this film is because of the previews, they were pretty comical. But three or four scenes don't make a movie. What's wrong with screen writers these days? Whoever wrote this must have been related to some one in upper management, otherwise it would have never been produced. The writer should have smoked the script, it would have saved us all some money.
__label__1 Dude whens it over: This movie starts out funny but towards the movie the storyline gets pretty old. Its definitaly not a classic or a good movie. And its super boring and not funny. My favorite part was when it was over.
__label__2 I wish i could give it 100 stars.. because i'm cool: what a hot film. so intelligent, so provocative. buy it. now.
__label__1 Dude, Where's My Car?: Fox has provided Dude, Where's My Car? with a great DVD package that consists of excellent picture and sound quality, along with a handful of cool extras that are sure to please fans. For those who have never seen the film, I recommend a rental if you're a fan of "stupid" comedies, as it is a fairly funny and entertaining flick. 2 stars.
__label__1 Pointless....: This movie was just dumb, but some parts were funny that why it got 2 stars. It seems like the move was trying too hard to be the next Bill & Ted...but you know that's not gonna happen.
__label__1 RENT BEFORE YOU BUY!: I was very dissapointed by this movie. It did not do well at the box office, and everyone else I know who saw it, did not like this movie. The story and all the characters are quite stupid.Everyone has a different sense of humor so I won't tell you what is and isn't funny, but due to popular opinion you may want to borrow or rent this movie if you intend to buy it.I am not in the bussiness of giving poor ratings, but I hope I can save you a few bucks.
__label__1 It is dumb: I borrowed this movie from my brother (thank goodness I didn't pay anything, even to rent it) and found it to be quite stupid. I love movies like Ace Ventura, Dumb & Dumber and Bill & Ted, and this is no where close to any of these. Contrary to other reviews, the only funny parts I found were the tatto scene (saw it 100 times in the commercials, but still laughed at it, when he draws it out--"Suuuuuweeeet! What does mine say?") and the bubble wrap parts. The Chinese restaurant scene was so not funny it actually made me mad.It gets two stars from me because I saw it for free after a long day with a sick child where I jsut wanted to get away from reality for a hour or two--it did accomplish that, but only minimally.
__label__2 Dude!!! Sweet!!!: This movie is SOOO funny!!! It's about these 2 party dudes trying to find their car in order to get their girlfriend's anniversery gifts in order to recieve 'special treats.' But along the way things don't go as planed. It's a comedy starring Ashton Kutcher and Sean Scott. YOU HAVE TO SEE IT!!!
__label__1 ehhhhh: I was REEEEALLY excited when I received my copy of this album. I took it to my car and started listening with the system blasting. I found myself pressing "next track" more than loving the music.It's definitely unique. Some of the songs are REEEALLY good, but the rest make up for it. Ugglor|Mossen might be one of the best songs I've ever heard. The rest of the cd can't compete though. The reason this album earned 2 stars is because this song is on it.I've reviewed a number of cds and box sets... if it's great GOA you're looking for you get you movin and groovin, go other places. It may be a great album for some of you looking for a unique sound that unmatchable (like I thought it would be), but I can't say I'm satisfied.
__label__1 Trinity: This was not what I was expecting. It wasn't as funny as any of the westerns. Nobody is my name for example. Very disappointed, not with deliver or anything just the content of the video itself.
__label__2 Newspapers are still a rag: "Infamous Scribblers" was a fantastic read. Newspapers haven't changed much since colonial times. the best part of the book was the historical facts brought up, and the infighting of politicians and printers, among themselves and with each other. It brought out things about our founding fathers that aren't in your regular history books. There is a very great likeness of events and people then and now, The one big difference today is newspapers don't attack like they did then. They didn't hold back much at all and would keep it up and not backdown. Give it a try I think you will enjoy it....Ken
__label__2 Very Fun Racing Game: Roadsters is one of those games that plays like an arcade racer but has real licensed cars. Both the graphics and the play control are very good and the cars are definetly cool. My only complaint was that there wasnt enough tracks. There are only 6 of them and after a while you just want more.
__label__2 Autumn, The City - ZOMBIE EXTRAVAGANZA!!!: This book was a great follow up to David Moody's first book in his Autumn series. The virus that has taken over the world has hit The City - plenty of new characters and twists and turns. Even though most zombie books are predictable, David Moody gives an exciting and new experience for zombie lovers. You almost feel like you are there... This book is hard to put down - when you get to the last 20 pages, you just want it to go on, and on, and on... Shame that David's Autumn series is not able to be purchased at book stores in Australia though, which means you have to pay a LOT OF MONEY for one book - BUT the books are Totally Worth It!!!! I LOVE the Autumn series, and cannot wait to purchase the next books in his Autumn series!
__label__1 Not First Printing: I bought this book thinking it was an adition to the autumn book line, it says first printing. I guess i need to pay closer attention because it is a reprint of the first book by a new publisher. Ripped off. I will not buy anything by this publisher again.
__label__1 The worst book I have ever finished!!: I can't believe people really enjoyed this book. It was tedious and dull. Nothing new happened once the stage was set. Of all the "zombie" reanimated-body books and movies, this has to take the cake as the worst, bar none. No character development at all. Nothing to make you care about any of the characters. No explanation or even conjecture about what the f_ _ _ has taken place. Just rotting flesh and shuffling bodies.
__label__1 I am now avoiding Moen faucets!: We had a Moen kitchen faucet with a "lifetime warranty." It is junk. It started dripping after 5 years, and the exterior actually started rusting.When I tried to replace the cartridge, the screw was so cheap the head partly disintigrated and required an extractor. I could go on...Don't be fooled into thinking you are getting quality when they advertise "lifetime warranty."In fairness, they sent a new cartridge, but what I want is quality in the first place.It will last a lifetime --as long as you don't live more than five years!
__label__2 If things were perfect, this album would be among them: Moby is more than a genius of techno, he is a genius of music. What he does in this album is so joyful and depressing simultaneously, I just want to listen to it over and over again. The best tracks are Porcelain, Why does my heart feel so bad?, Southside, Natural Blues, and Run On. And the rest are still amazing songs.
__label__2 A MASTERPIECE of Electronic Music: This is truly a electronic masterpiece and will never been forgotten. I have been a big fan of Moby for quite some time now, but I have found myself skipping a song here or their on some of his other albums. This CD is one of those CD's you want to leave on repeat all day, and listen to it through and through. On this album Moby remixes a lot of old blues songs, and briliantly brings them to life. He takes electronic music to a whole new level with this album. If you don't own any Moby, start here. And if you love the smash hit "Porcelain" or "Everloving" you'll want to check out his album "I Like to Score" as another great Moby CD to own. If you haven't started listening to Electronic music at all START HERE!
__label__2 Excellent: Moby's latest album touches on many genres of music, and it sounds fantasctic. Instantly recognisable tunes hit you, and no wonder companies are queueing up to have his music play on their adverts. One of the best things about play is the number of songs on the album, a massive 18! It is guarenteed that everyone will like most of the tunes, because of the contrast in styles. If you buy one album this year, MAKE IT THIS ONE
__label__2 Great CD!: Very good CD, it makes me think about everything and its good when your working or when your sleeping. It have one or two "bad" songs but the rest are top quality. "My Weekness" always makes me think and put me in good mud. And if you enjoy the essays of Moby, then you'll love it! I advice you to buy it...
__label__2 Moby Continues His Great Style: The first song I ever heard of Moby was his techno remix of James Bond. Since then I've been hooked on his music, and he certainly doesn't disapoint on this great album. One thing that Moby has, is a unique sound. He will never sound old, or his style of music will never be used by others, because no one could copy Moby. It isn't Rock, nor techno. it's something in between On this album, all the songs are strong, but in particular I think the song "why does my heart feel so bad" is the best. It pours out the most emotion without a doubt. It was used in the trailers of Black Hawk Down, and was used perfectly. Overall, if you are a fan of Moby, Buy this album!!
__label__1 Don't fall for it! Your heart isn't made of plastic!: Why is this album held in such high regard? It sounds like some middle class white kid messing with his parents gospel records. The gritty heart-felt gospel recordings juxtaposed with the cold, synthetic, superficial beats, create an unsettling tension that sounds unintended. He should be made to leave his room and go out and get some exercise.
__label__2 An album for Christians and non-Christians alike.: You can dance, groove, bob your head and be touched emotionally all in one sitting. This CD simply rocks!
__label__2 he gets it right: Your ears will thank you for buying this album. You can really chill out to it with all the musical styles covered - pop, techno, rock but where it really shines is the bluesy gospel/electronic fusion with the awesome tracks Natural Blues & Run On, yes I love the blues but you don't have to be biased towards any particular type of music to enjoy this album as it cleverly mixes most genres. Easily 5 stars as I can't think of any weak points on this.
__label__1 moby = genius ¿? why ¿?: People are saying that moby is like a god, that he is one of the world best producer, people say that his this record, Play, is the album of the year, ¿?. I have heard this is the best techno album ever. I cannot understand this things. Please forgive me, but in my view, Play is simply a bad album. The only thing moby has made, is sample some old soul vinyls, and put music behind. And believe me, that the only good things of this album are these voices, which are the only things moby has not made. The drums are simply bad produced, the music is simply, and his voice is, oh my god!, why anybody has say to moby that he cannot sign?. You could say me you like some of the album songs, but please, DON'T SAY ME THAT MOBY IS A GOOD PRODUCER AND DON'T SAY THAT PLAY IS ONE OF THE BEST 90's ALBUM!!!
__label__1 There is NO way this CD is one of the best of the 1999: I purchased this CD because everyone is raving about it. I mean I ever heard about it on a night time sitcom...but whatever the case, I found this CD a utter disappointment. granted there are a couple tracks that I thought were okay, but the rest of the CD was a waste. I mean what is going on with the chanting. The bottom line here is people loved this CD becasue it was new, not that it was great.
__label__2 Results IN: Moby pulls off the album of the year.: I am not even done listening to every track yet, yet I know this is the one. Moby pretty much pulls off the album of the year. Artists of the likes of Madonna and Beck will be calling this guy for some of his expertise. He has broken ground by creating a beautiful unexpected hybrid: Gospel/Blues and Electronic music. Forget Fatboy Slim, or Slim Shady or Will Smith, get with Moby, and get with him now. "Play" not only rocks your mind, but touches your soul....All without putting you to sleep, being illegal, or selling you out.(Headphones recommended)
__label__2 let's play: This was my first Moby CD and I brought it for my fiance's birthday. We both love it! We have brought the CD Wait for me and Last Night since then. Moby knocks the socks off of Lady G
__label__1 New Age Muzak takes a (Hip) Hop: Why isn't this guy on the Wyndham Hill label? Lightweight music and, in the liner notes, lightweight musings. Not necessarily bad, but I don't own an elevator.
__label__2 A very good cd: This is a very good cd you should buy it! My favourite songs are Why does my heart feel so bad,Porcelain,guitar flute and stings and 7 although almost all songs on the album are good!
__label__2 remix: I like the CD. I found a real interesting way to be a part of Moby's music by mixing your own version of body rock at beatnik.com.
__label__2 MOBY'S TITLE SIMPLY SAYS IT....PLAY: A really good CD....I wouldn't classify it techno, but great pop...It has it all dance rock, slow, medium....my favorite cut is "Bodyrock"...gets my butt of the couch and rock...I was surprised to see it as the theme song now to "Veronica's Closet" on NBC...you should catch the intro on the show, it is pretty rockin!....Any way back to the album, other great songs are the ambient "My Weakness" and the soul full "Run On". Catch this CD soon, it will fit all tastes.
__label__1 Never received it!: I'm sure if I had received it instead of the cloth map that was sent, I would have loved it. I returned the map and asked that the light be sent as originally ordered. This never happened and I ended up asking for a refund.
__label__2 Loooooooooooove this book!: I read this book over 13 years ago, and I tell you, it still remains one of my faves. Even though I was barely 13 when I read it, the book gave me hope and made me believe that anyone could become something, no matter their background and especially like Emma's.
__label__1 The loudest stealth ever: Sadly this product performs admirably with supplying power but where it fails is its stealth. Check out OCZs forums for many complaints about it being quite loud. Apparently they've kind of messed with all their customers and created an extremely loud product that is difficult to return to most e-tailers.FYI some retailers have newer revisions of these units that are much quieter but the UPCs are exactly the same so good luck finding one. Buy it amazon or B&M; or better yet, just stay away.
__label__1 I'm glad I'm not the only one....: This phone was fantastic for about 8 months. I could go about 100 yards from my house while talking without any interference. However in the last month the handset started "Channel Searching" no matter how close I was to the base and how good the signal. Two days ago the handset went into channel search mode and literally has not stopped searching since. I have done everything I can think of including change the battery and it continues to search and while it searches the answering machine doesn't seem to work. Oh well, no more Sony for me.
__label__1 Ditto, don't waste your money: We've had this telephone for about one year, and we love the features. However, we've had to replace the battery already (the replacement is very expensive, as batteries go). Also, the phone is constantly muting -- it makes a terrible clicking sound, too -- resulting in having to ask people to repeat themselves over and over. It must be channel surfing, but there is no need for this. I will be buying another phone, but not a Sony.
__label__2 Pretty good wipes, but a little thin: I have been using Pampers wipes pretty much from the beginning and I really love the pop-up tub and the different fragrances they come in. These sensitive ones are especially good for newborns. My only complaint is they are thin. I usually use 2 at a time, more if my son has a messy diaper. I recently tried Huggies wipes and they are thicker, but they don't pop up. I don't like reaching in the tub as much as a the pop up, so I guess I'll stay with these.
__label__2 True Corporate America: Probably the funniest movie about corporate America that I have EVER seen. From disgruntled employees to annoying co-workers, this movie has it all. A definate buy. If you enjoy movies like Caddy Shack and Princess Bride, you will love this.
__label__2 Satirical and funny...: I've just started studying an MBA in the U.S.(I am going through my second semester), and I saw this film a couple of weeks ago. The first ten minutes did not tell me anything good, since it seemed one of those low budget, "C" type, uninteresting comedies that invite you to switch channel.I am glad I didn't, because we eventually had a lot of fun with the dialogs and situations, a long discussion after the film was finished, and I saw lots of things that have to do with my management courses...Very recommendable, either to de-stress, or to realize that THAT (all the bad karma and nonsense by people who just want to control you and your life) is what you want to avoid, by all means. On the job, or in everyday life...
__label__1 Trying...: The first word that came to mind while thinking of this film was 'odious' but I'll do it a bit of a service and say it's merely *trying.* I watched it on Amazon instant (I like the service but keep in mind I am no hard-core cinephile, my concern is the story alone, not so much the technology) and made it through to the end.I felt rather ragged afterwards. The character of Milton left perhaps the biggest impression on me - he looked and sounded and acted like a Muppet, particularly Beaker. That was a very trying element in this film. I felt like I was watching a strange permutation of James Thurber's The Catbird Seat, told in a backwards way from some unimportant background characters.The protagonist didn't feel like a protagonist. The only really wonderful piece of acting was that of Mr. Lumberg, whose dry, grueling "that would be great," stole the show. It was grotesque and hilarious.Otherwise, this was a legitimately unsatisfying film. I don't plan on watching it again.
__label__2 Office Space Blu Ray Review: I purchased this through Prime as an extra Christmas gift for the household. We haven't had a chance to watch it yet, but I've seen the movie before. It's one of the best movies ever, and I won't even say what I paid for it on here because I don't know what they're asking for it now. I just know that I got an exceptional deal, I think it was a gold box or something. I'm looking forward to watching this version to see what the special flair is all about, but I did get a great price on this, shipping was fast through prime and I'm happy with my purchase.
__label__2 perfect christmus gift for manager or co worker: We recently organised a pot luck for our team an I selected this as gift. I sticked yellow note sticker all over the dvd case and left the words "WORK SUCKS" visible out side. when one of my co worker picked this gift and read read the sentence there was a big laugh in the room. and when he opened (removed the stickers) every one said it was the perfect gift with perfect packing for the occasion.Anyway movie is one of my favourite and must watch.
__label__2 I Believe You Have My Stapler....: Ok, a few years ago, I worked for a major HMO last year. I was also confined to a small gray cubicle for 8 hours a day. And after watching Office Space, I quit a month later. Coincidence? Maybe. But it was like watching my life unfold on screen! Like having 4 bosses "remind" you about a tiny mistake that doesn't really matter, the doggone fax machine that is your sworn enemy, and of course the office FREAK, who you know is gonna someday show up to the work place armed! This movie has it all, and it's hilarious! So, if you ever get a case of the "mondays", call in sick,blow off those dang TPS reports, and watch this movie!
__label__2 love this movie: I bought this for a friend who had never seen it. I was going to let them borrow mine, but decided to just get them their own since it was so reasonable. Gotta love it!
__label__2 milton is the MAN: aaahhhh this movie sticks with you and is total classic comedy. from basic humor of just wierd names to the eternal red stapler this is an amazingly hilarious movie. i have never even been inside a cubicle (thank god) and i think this movie may have influenced that. milton certainly steals the show and then i see the same actor on a csi episode and realize he can talk normally and HAS NO RED STAPLER??? *GASP* but anyway...anyone can enjoy this movie whether they are a cubie with a tyrant boss or standing in the unemployment line. this is a new CLASSIC in my book.
__label__1 Office Space: I ordered the movie Office Space, but when I received it I had Happy Gilmore in an "Office Space" package. It was sealed and everything. I was very disappointed in Amazon's service, in sending me the wrong movie! Will not do that again!
__label__2 Some of the funniest scenes, with an overall bland plot: I love this movie. It has so many individual scenes that are hilarious. The overall plot and story aren't the greatest, but I've found most people can over look this.This movie is rated R, and I think its one of the tamest R movies I've seen. There is brief nudity and a fair amount of swearing (mainly in rap music). However, the R rating may be for the best since I don't think anyone under the driving age will think this movie is all that funny. It's mainly work related and relationship comedy. I am thrilled to say there is no "bodily fluid" humor that has been in so many movies lately.The DVD features are almost nonexistant.
__label__2 That's greeeeat.: Rather than comment on the film, I'll comment in the disc itself. Worthwhile set of extra features, but it's not an action film so the widescreen doesn't add much. A note on the 'Digital Locker' content: 1.you may not be able to view it. 2.it may lock up your browser. 3.the deleted scene is on the disc anyway. Summary: Buy it if you like Office Space, not because of the widescreen and Digital Locker content. BTW although it's zone 1 NTSC it played just fine on my zone 4 PAL DVD player.
__label__2 Funny classic just like your were there: This one makes me laugh everytime, if you've ever worked in a cubicle you will appreciate the humor and the office politics.
__label__2 Cult Classic!: If you have ever worked in an office environment, you have to see this movie.I've watched this movie over 100 times and I still can't stop laughing.I still use quotes from this movie on a daily basis.
__label__2 Simply the best...: Yeah... I'm going to have to "go ahead" and rent this movie again because I missed most of it due to the fact that I was laughing too hard to keep up with the story line.Seriously though, this movie was simply the best movie I've ever seen. Other than the types of people the movie was being critical of, (mindless corporate suits and drones), I can't imagine anybody not loving this film.
__label__2 Life imitates Dilbert: If you've ever worked in a cubicle farm, spoken "corporatese," or dealt with downsizing, you'll find Office Space to be hilariously relevant. Created by Mike Judge of Beavis and Butthead fame, this movie could easily pass for a live-action version of the Dilbert cartoon. It pokes fun at everything from commuting to office birthday parties to "fast casual" chain restaurants. Watching Office Space, you will vicariously get the satisfaction of "sticking it to the man." Ron Livingston plays the lead role well, but the funniest characters are the supporting cast - Milton, Lundbergh, Drew, et. al. I'm going to need you to go ahead an watch Office Space...yeah...that would be great...
__label__1 hate it: this would have been a good movie but the language ruined it all. will never watch again in fact will probably destroy it. language like that does not make a movie!
__label__2 This is the only movie I have watch over 5 times!: I love this whole movie! I is my all time favorite. I am not really a movie goer but this is one that I have played over and over again and never get tired of it."Corprate Account Payable, Nina Speaking ...Just a moment!"I have been in a cube most my life and so much rings true....this is a celebrated movie and a tribute to all of us that work in the corprate world!I happen to like me work, getting there was a struggle...we all have been Peter Gibbons at one point or another in our career!"Hey Peter....Watch you Corn$%#"There are so many lines from the movie that just make me laugh. I know the budject for the movie was 10Mil..and I knowthat opening week it did 4mil...10 mill total...but the DVD is a cult classic...it must be reeling in the bucks!
__label__2 A Great Flick!: A must-see for anyone that has ever worked in a cubicle environment, hated work, got pissed-off at a printer, hates the boss, or feels trapped in a deadend job. The deliberate humor slaps you in the face from the get-go and continues to do so throughout the entire film. If you need a good laugh to forget the stress of your crappy job, then you need to see this movie.
__label__1 Get out of your cubicle and see some real comedy!!!: ... Although this movie has a few moments that will bring a smile to your face (the same kind of smile you get as you pass gas), it is certainly not among the best comedic efforts of all time-.......A much better film in the same vein would be Bruce Robinson's HOW TO GET AHEAD IN ADVERTISING <Criterion Collection>(Executively produced by George Harrison)...Even some episodes of the Drew Carey show, and the old Mary Tyler Moore TV Series are better than this film!
__label__1 Busted DVD: I ordered a widescreen version from this retailer. Not only did I get a fullscreen version in the mail (along with an invoice that confirmed I ordered the widescreen), the DVD would not play in any player I owned (which is 4). Tried to get in touch with customer service, but after a nightmare and a long headache I decided to just give up my ten dollars as lost and buy the film at Best Buy. Don't use this retailer!!!
__label__1 Not really that good...: When I started working in office (and a cubicle), all of my friends told me that I had to watch "Office Space" because it is so much like work and it's hilarious. Finally, I did get a chance to watch it... but I ended up being quite diappointed. Yes, there are some funny parts to the movie, but I was more disgusted with some of the supposed "humor." It could be that I tend to like movies that have some value or even a plot (even if it didn't have either, some HUMOR could have been good). I could have done without this movie, but at least now my friends will quit bugging me to watch it.Word of advice: I wouldn't watch it with kids or with older parents. Actually, I wouldn't watch it at all.
__label__2 Office Space (1999): This movie is for anyone who has suffered a printer jam, worked next to someone loud and annoying, had a boss from Hell. This movie will get you to laugh. Especially enjoyable on particularly bad week at work (preferably cubical style).
__label__2 Laughing at Ourselves: There are a lot of funny movies out there, but not many can be said to have so perfectly skewered their subject that they become archetypes. "Office Space" fits this latter category, doing for the modern, post-1980 workplace what "Monty Python and the Holy Grail" did for the Arthurian legend. That is to say, "Office Space" has become a part of our common culture, with shared concepts like "pieces of flair" and "Is this good for the COMPANY?" being common to the experience not only of cubicle slaves but all of us.Further, "Office Space", despite its outrageous plot, is just close enough to the truth of modern corporate America to hit home. Companies do promote incompetents and lay off their most skilled workers, all in the name of short-term quarterly profits. They do treat their employees like drones while rewarding upper management for cheating shareholders. To see this all turned against them goes a long way in explaining the success of "Office Space." It's a classic.
__label__2 So real it hurt: The year was 1999. I was working as a customer service representative in an office that looked eerily like the one in this movie. You know, one of those utterly bland suburban campuses. Our company had just hired "efficiency consultants" to "analyze" the business. Then one day a bunch of people get laid off. While there, management introduced a new phone system for tracking how we spent our time. We actually had to enter a code to use the bathroom so they could know how much time we were there.I remember sitting in the movie theater, not sure whether I should laugh or cry. Now 5 years later I can definitely laugh. I love the bit about the TPS report memo and the red stapler. Lots of rough language, but otherwise a real gem.
__label__2 NOT just another space shooter: When I first began speculating about this game with friends way back in 98'. All I heard was it was gonna be another space shooter that could not rate up there with games like X-Wing or TIE fighters. Man, I still will never forget the looks on their faces when I showed them how the game ran and just overall was a masterpiece of graphics and gameplay for it's time anyway. So your saying, yeah well what's the story with this game? Well, you start out as a GTA pilot (Galactic Terran Alliance) fighting a 14 year war against the Vasudans. The AI is impressive as is the combat animations and cutscenes. All I can say to anyone considering buying this is to get it before it is no longer made considering it's age. Enjoy!
__label__2 Works great, holds the phone, cool looking (for a charger): I hate the phone charger business, and have gone through piles of third-party chargers over the years. With my A310, phone chargers would just fall out. So far so good with this one, plus the glowing tip (besides just being neat-o) makes it easy to find. I wish there was a way to tell top v. bottom in the dark, but that's not really a problem (and I've never had a charger that did).Highly recommended.
__label__1 Mother Night: Good shipping but the pages were screwed up! At about 170 it reverts back to 79 and repeats 40 pages leaving 40 pages of the novel out! Terrible! How the hell did this happen! Check the pages.
__label__1 A bit disappointing.: It's vintage Vonnegut, but doesn't bristle like Slaughterhouse 5, B of Champions, or Galapagos. If you haven't tasted the genius of KV, I'd suggest pushing this one to the edge of your plate until you've chewed on some of his other works.William Olson, author of Right on Time.
__label__2 Steinbeck is good but E.B. White is better: Steinbeck's book are often quite earthy and rough. I think he had a macho image he wanted to maintain in part. He was a good writer (Noble prize, Pulitzer) and "Travels With Charley" is a wonderful book. It is not in this collection however. I find it difficult to swallow his profanity and it is never necessary (read Dickens for instance). In comparison, E.B. White had a gracious side to his writing, a wonderful subtle sense of humor and a beauty of economy with the English language. I like them both but prefer White. I mention the two together because they were both writing at the same time. They were both perfectionists and both hated to be in the public spotlight.
__label__1 What started out to be a beautiful movie....thrown in the trash!: This was recommended to be a wonderful movie, not to be missed, in our local small town paper.Indeed it started out to be just that, even with viewing it in-between the English subtitles (German made, German language) Magnificent scenes of Africa, and beautiful people all through out. Then, right in the middle, and totally unnecessary by all standards, very graphic sex scenes between 2 of the characters. I could not believe it! It ruined what could have been a totally beautiful movie in scenery and story. I was so angry I immediately threw it in the biggest trash can I could find. I was so angry I didn't want to talk about it, let alone give time to write a review, until now. Enough said, don't waste time or money on this movie. I still have yet to speak to the man who wrote the recommendation but will the next time I see him. (I live out in the wilds of our Island, not in the town)
__label__2 the choices we have to make will always haunt us: a brilliant character study of an upper middle class jewish german family who escape to kenya in the days before world war 2. having to adjust to a different world, having to learn to confront her own racism (irony of ironies), having to face up to a marriage where she is unable to love as much as she is herself loved, star juliane kohler manages to give a broad and poignant performace, as does the rest of the cast, highlighted by sidede onyulo as the african cook who becomes confessor and friend to the family. let us be thankful that others got ahold of the source material before the likes of meryl streep found it. a great film, in my top 100.
__label__2 Great Movie!!!: A very compelling story about a boy and his colt, awesome heartwelming family adventure horse lovers will most entirely love!!!

__label__2 Good book, obnoxious author: The Oregon Trail is an undeniable classic -- although overrated compared to other books written about the same time about the same subject. Parkman is a priggish, Boston snob who complains his way across the West. He despises the pioneers crossing the plains and has no interest in them -- a startling lack of consciousness for a historian. The Indians and the mountain men fare little better. A better, more generous book by a young man in the west is Wah-to-Yah and the Taos Trail by Lewis H. Garrard.Smallchief
__label__1 Hardly the Oregon Trail: This book was a disappointment to me and I should have researched it more before purchasing it. It was my hope to read about the settlers moving West on the old Oregon Trail but this book had nothing to do with that. Instead, it was an account of Parkman's experiences as he traveled in some of the Western areas of the U.S. (Wyoming area, Black Hills, etc.) Much of his time was spent with the various Indian tribes as he befriended them and learned much of their culture. He also spent a great deal of time hunting. My real problem with his story is that it was so repetitive. Many of the accounts were similar and it seemed like we were going over and over the same thing. I read almost every thing I can find on Western adventure and exploration but this one is sure not on the top of my list.
__label__1 Not a happy customer: This seller claims that if not satisfied with the product, they will issue you a refund as long as you send the product back within 30 days. Well is almost a month since I send the products back and I havent seeing no refund yet. I tried calling and sending the seller messages with no luck they wont return my calls or write. I also think that phone number given is fake, because nobody ever answers the phone.
__label__2 A Truly Loud Phone: I purchased this phone for my 90 year old mother who wears two hearing aids. Not only can she finally hear me on the phone, but she can use it while keeping her hearing aid in her ear. She has not heard this well on the phone for over ten years. I highly recommend this product.
__label__1 Ho-Hum........: With all the great material in the WEA vaults, why Warner Music UK chose to package and release these also-rans is a mystery. The material has a boring sameness to it I am not used to in an Oldies Collection. Dee Dee Warwick, Darrow Fletcher, Barbara Lynn & Mary Wells are all outstanding artists that I normally look forward to listening to, but who you would not normally identify with the disco or pre-disco period of American music. The selections on this CD display these and other artists' work out of their normal areas of expertise. This one is surely going to a back shelf.
__label__1 Exploitation of sibling...: This book was terrible, it was an expolitation of his brother, and a shameless way to promote his other books. No matter the situation, the author found a way to make a reference to another book he had wrote. It was poorly written, and jumps around quite a bit. Don't waste your time or money on this book, or any book of this author's.
__label__1 Uninspiring Cd: The songs are third rated ones that do not inspire. Listening to these songs had to be one time only deal.
__label__2 This is Great!!!: I bought this for my husband to be for Christmas. He grew up with the F Troop and wanted this. He loves it. I am very happy with my purchase. Great entertainment and it is CHILD SAFE comedy.
__label__1 It's A Bust: Warning, this game does not run on Windows XP or Windows 2000.I bought this yesterday for $2.99 at the local computer store. Took it home, and tried to install it. First, the setup program wanted to install DirectX 7 on my system, whereas I have DirectX 9 already.Next, I start the game, and it crashes almost instantly. Check the box... it says "Windows 95/98". Since I have XP, I assume I'm OK. Then I check the Interplay web site... Aha! This game does not work on Windows XP. Well, for $2.99, it was a small gamble on my part to buy it. It might be a good game, but I can't tell you for sure.
__label__1 Good book bad Digitization: The digital copy of this book is poor with artifacts on almost every other page, makes it difficult to read at points, definitely not worth the price for the effort the publisher put in.
__label__1 Dull: I'm not sure why this book got so many five star reviews. It's not a terrible book, but I found it to be incrediably predictable and dull. I had pretty much figured out everything that was going to happen within the first hundred pages or so. There wasn't much point in finishing it. I love long books, but this one was pointlessly so. Wolfe goes into a lot of useless rambling that has little if nothing to do with the plot. I found myself skimming many of the pages without feeling I has missed out on anything important. Definately the sort of book you read only if there is nothing else around.
__label__2 Attention to Detail: The Bonfire of the Vanities clearly made several strong points about racism, sexism and capitalism in America, but I personally enjoyed the attention Wolfe paid to developing the characters and situations each character was in. All the plot lines are just built up by the indepth description of how each character was involved. The reader is never left wondering why the characters are doing what they are doing, but everything is very obviously connected by Wolfe's previous narrative that it gives the reader something to look to for clarification. Specific events such as the mayors obsession with mayonnaise "who in the name of God would bring a half eaten jar of mayonnaise to a public meeting?" or Sherman's confusion in the Bronx "Who on Earth would take the trouble to shove a chair in a chicken wire fence in this neighborhood?" also shows the actual character's detail orientedness, and perhaps shows that focus on detail is an inherent human flaw.
__label__2 Very Good: Pretty good. Like the DC version, very well done. But I really hoped to see more of the earlier artwork by the original artists for the older chartacters.
__label__2 Spans the Generations of Marvel Characters: A great gift for Marvel readers and a coffee table book for Marvel Families. This book brings back memories and provides helpful chronology. In the sixties, Iron Man was yellow, the X-Men were blue and yellow, and Daredevil was black and yellow. Marvel sure liked yellow.
__label__2 this book is a marvel: MY SON IS GOING TO BE THRILLED WITH THIS BOOK ON CHRISTMAS, THIS BOOK IS TRULY WONDERFUL. I AM VERY HAPPY THAT I RECIEVED IT VERY QUICK, AND THE BOOK IS JUST GREAT. THANK YOU FOR RESPONDING SO QUICKLY.I KNOW HE WILL BE THRILLED TO GET THIS TO ADD TO HIS COLLECTION. THANKS MUCH AGAIN KATHLEEN SERWIN
__label__1 could have had more surfing: When i saw the cover i was very exited to see big wave surfing, I was very unhappy with this movie as all the shot of the surfing scene are taken from a helicopter. Its a nice introduction to big wave surfing but nothing compare to riding giants or the billabong odisey. The rock climbing was also so so. The snow board scenes are nice as always but nothing special.Overall this blu ray is good but doesnt show you anything new or that you event seen before.
__label__2 Review by: Christine Stevens: It has the episode Angel on it w/David Boreanaz...what eles do you want
__label__2 nice set of songs: THERE IS NOTHING BAD TO SAY ABOUT THIS EXCELLENT COLLECTION OF SONGS,NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES THEY HAVE BEEN RELEASED BEFORE.THE SONGS HAVE STOOD THE TEST OF TIME AND ARE CLASSIC PERFORMANCES BY THE MOST CLASSIC ENTERTAINER OF ANY GENRE OF ALL TIME.IF YOU DO NOT ALREADY HAVE A COLLECTION OF THESE SONGS I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THAT YOU PURCHASE THIS SET AND ENJOY THE FEEL GOOD MUSIC.THERE IS ONLY ONE ELVIS .
__label__2 What I expected: These headphones delivered exactly what I expected from a $41 set, good sound but lacking in the noise-cancellation department. The fabric cord with an extension piece is nice and the design makes it fun to wear. The switch for noise cancelling on/off is well located as it doesn't take up room on a seperate piece or on the cord and the foldable design makes the headphones relatively easy to transport with big pockets. Basicly, everything one can expect from Sony for $41. (Since flying with them I would change this to a 3 review... they just didn't deliver much with the noise cancelling.
__label__1 Terrible Headphones: I only bought these because my cat chewed on my sony fontopia headphones and I was low on cash, and these were on sale for $25. I figured they hold me over for a week or two. A minute into the first song I regretted buying them. First of all, they're ugly as all hell. The only reason i got them is because they said they were noise cancelling and the original price was $70. The noise cancelling consists of a distracting static frequency, and there is no bass whatsoever. These are honestly terrible headphones. I should have gotten $15 sony earbuds, i would have been much happier.
__label__1 Another verbal window into the past: Once again,McDermott's verbal mastery takes you to the place of which she writes as clearly as if looking through a window on the scenes she describes so vividly. However, compared to "Charming Billy", this piece is disappointing. While very well written descriptively, I found it slow. The opening act caught my attention and I continued to read hoping for more of the same alure...it was not to be found. I actually skipped paragaphs and entire pages and was able to continue as if the skipped parts were of no importance to the story at all. While I would recommend Ms. McDermott's work, I would not recommend this particular book.
__label__1 Disappointed: I didn't find the music relaxing or energizing. I was too distracted by the fact that it reminded me of bad early 80s music. But on the plus side, it made me want to put on a shiny leotard and leg warmers.
__label__2 Inspiring: I listened to this book on cd which I have found is a great way to get insirational advice everyday and further myself as a person. I loved C.S Lewis's Mere Christianity. It gives a educated view into why he believes in God and more specifically the Christian God. He is a great writer and the book is very intellegent. I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone.
__label__1 Primitive concepts outdated by todays understanding: I have no doubt that C.S. Lewis was a fine man and he certainly set out to achieve a noble goal here. Making the spiritual more understandable through the application of logic has an undeniable appeal. Unfortunately, his assumptions about some of the basic concepts of human nature look positively naive by modern standards. He comes off sounding like, as one of my psych professors was fond of saying, a "park-bench philosopher". Behavioral science just had not developed to the point it has today, so he had no way of knowing that his basic assumptions about some things he viewed as givens were, in fact, not given at all. In the end, trying to make the subject of religion something that one can put to the test of "logic" is an exercise in futility. That's why it's called faith.
__label__1 Merely the same things rehashed: I recieved this book as a gift from someone I thought to be an open-minded, good person. This book has nothing new in it. It is worthless. It is just another example of a poor deluded SOB trying to convince himself that he really likes the cage he was tricked into entering.This book is prosylazation. Prosylatizers, I have found, try to convert people because they are insecure about their faith, and think that by converting the world they will be secure in their faith. The truly faithful person does not prosylatize, for if one is secure in one's faith, why preach? If I could give this book a NEGATIVE FIVE, I would.
__label__1 disappointing and childish: I bought this book hoping to find an intelligent defense of faith, given that the author is such a well respected fiction writer. Unfortunately, what I found were the kinds of arguments that I used while in grade school and discarded soon thereafter. If you've thought critically about anything at any point in your life, you're not going to get anything out of this book.
__label__1 Quality works in poor quality packaging: For the last week I have been like a little child waiting for a birthday present to come in the mail. I have joyfully anticipated receiving this boxed set of C.S. Lewis treasures. At last, it came today. What a disappointment! If the covers of these books last through more than one reading, I will be surprised. The covers are beautiful, but the quality is poor, and certainly not worth the $47.90 I paid for this set. I was looking forward to something that would last for years to come. Oh well, I won't be sending the set back, because I'm anxious to read these incredible works (the first books I will have read in several years). If this review was about C.S. Lewis, it would be five stars. But, this review is about the shoddy quality of this set, and hence the single star review. Buyer beware.
__label__2 The best explanation of the core of Christianity I have read. Fascinating.: It has been a while since I last got excited about a book, but this book inspired me. This book gives both rational arguments for Christianity and sound explanations of core Christian doctrines.
__label__1 Book: The book took a while to get here, and when it did, it was in rough shape for supposedly being brand new. I also discovered I could have bought it for $5 cheaper from another online retailer. Not too impressed with this purchase.
__label__2 One More Review!: Hundreds of reviews of this book have been written over the years. And no wonder! It's author did not become a Christian til in his 40's when he came, as he tells it, "kicking and screaming into the kingdom!"He's heavy weight intellectual (taught both Oxford and Cambridge) but able to write clearly for us commoners as well. The many copies I have given away over the years have gone to Christians who need a clearer understanding of their faith, as well as to nonChristians who need to understand that Christianity is quite intellectually respectable - and possibly even TRUE!
__label__2 Seeing the Truth in the Logic: For those of us that are more logical and analytical in our thinking, CS Lewis illustrates logically the need to not only acknowledge but address the existence of God but make a choice in where we stand and what we consider Truth. Use this as a starting point in a lifelong journey to gain an accurate picture of who God is.
__label__2 Great book: Loved kindle for iPad can't go wrong I buy as many books as possible this way. Quick down load and you get your stuff right away
__label__1 Why all the hype? A huge letdown.: In all fairness, I wasn't able to finish this novel. The author seems to have a singular obsession with things sexual to the exclusion of most of the important characteristics of a good story.If you like the theme of a woman's sexual liberation, read Chopin's _The Awakening_ or Lawrence's _Lady Chatterley's Lover_ instead. (Besides, the sex is much better in _LCL_.) In addition to tackling this controversial subject, these books are masterfully written and classics for all time.
__label__1 Not very enlightening: As someone who has a genuine phobia of flying I thought that this book might provide some useful insights. After about a hundred pages I realized that it was just a lot of lurid filth. It is a total con. I ended up throwing it off the train somewhere in the middle of Manitoba. Probably the biggest rip since the Neverending Story.
__label__1 A disappointing book.: The heroine is a bloody racist (which is taken for wit, I guess). What a turn-off.
__label__1 Too thin: I wanted to like these pants so bad. I'm 5'8'' 135 Lbs and they were too short for me. I guess I'm a little anal when it comes to my pants being long enough, but regardless, they were way too thin. I have a pair of Adidas and prefer their dry-fit fabric over these. These are for sure a summer pant.
__label__1 Why do people like this?: The costumes and sets aren't too bad, but otherwise this looks like a bad TV movie from the 70s usually does. I agree that there is less of the melodrama than in Cecil DeMille's film, but the writing and acting are still painful to watch, and the picture is always dark. It must be that people feel nostalgic about something from years gone by, because this movie looks so very bad compared to classics of the past and modern filmmaking.
__label__2 Magnifique: Eurasia's most inspired duo.Flashbacks envelope a bullet to the future.Not for the faint of heart.
__label__1 FUTUREDOC: I have been through most of the test preperation books in the market, but this I was very optimistic upon coming to this book. The book itself is not written in a "user-friendly" manner, and the best parts of this book are the 3,500 word vocab list. The math section is very comprehensive, however, the questions are a lot harder than those found on the SAT, which eventually starts to discourage you. I verbal review sections are practically useless, and the strategies do not work. Once again, buy this book only for the vocabulary list, and then move on to some other book (such as kaplan, etc...). This list will give you the foundation to answer analogies and sentencecompletions but nothing more...The practice tests are quite useless, and are much harder than that found on the real SAT...Good luck on you test preperation
__label__1 Solid math review but lacks application for the SAT: Having tested many books that deal with the SAT I was positively surprised by the depth this book provided. The problem is the fact that the sample questions in it do not really reflect the real SAT-test and can only be used to study the math or the critical thinking skills.Also, dont plan to use this book to brush up your vocabulary - the included word-list provides you with only the meanings of the words and not with a sample sentence.This book might be suitable for usage in combination with 10 Real SATs or some other book that features more realistic SAT questions.
__label__1 Below average CD, I was left very disappointed: This is probably the worst CD Sawyer Brown has ever came out with. Out of the 11 songs, only about 4 are worth listening to. I recommend you listen to it before you waste any of your hard earned cash on this.
__label__1 a story hidden in words: Way too many names, Way too much detail.There is a story hidden in this book, but it is hard to dig it out. It could have been a good read.
__label__1 Aimless and self-absorbed: This book was one of the most boring books I've had to read in a long time. I found the writing to be unimaginative and felt like the book had no direction. I was very disappointed and had forgotten it before it was even finished.
__label__1 Could Have Been A Fun Movie For The Kids: With the slinging of rubber playground balls and the realistic sound of the ball hitting and stinging its mark (how'd they capture that!) and the bathroom humor, this could have been a movie that I enjoyed with my children! HOWEVER, the sexual innuendo and outright poor language, as well as the girl-girl kiss and "crotch enhancement" received by the Stiller character makes this a movie that I'm tossing in the trash can. What a drag!
__label__1 Not worthy of One Star. If the Academy gave out Oscars for: Worst movie, worst acting, and worst script, this would win hands down. When it comes to lame, witless and downright stupid movies, Ben Stiller is on quite a roll. If you are not a teenaged boy, I recommend staying away from this one.Dodgeball fancies itself as a parody of the typical sports movie, don't fall for it. The non-stop toilet humor is lame and predictable and it's a wonder that this movie can garner such rave reviews from so many people.In my humble opinion, if you have an IQ greater than 12, don't bother with Dodgeball. Personally, I'd sooner watch a marathon of Paulie Shore and Carrot Top movies before sitting thru Dodgeball again, and that my friends, is saying something.
__label__2 Worth the price of admission: I dont know how anyone could not laugh at this movie. It seems to appeal to all types of audiences that enjoy light humor. I wasnt a fan of Ben Stiller until this move. He is very funny in it. Despite the focus on humor, it is not entirely predictable and has some suprises in store for the audience.
__label__2 Not Bad: This movie was really silly, but I thought it was quite watchable. I was impressed actually. I wouldn't mind watching it again. Usually I don't like Ben Stiller movies, but I laughed at some of the stuff he did in this one. I guess it may be because I respect antagonists more than protagonists.The plot in this movie doesn't matter much. No one cares about it. This movie is for nothing but cheap laughs. Fortunately the cheap laughs aren't limited to endless shots of people getting hit in the groin. There's a whole variety of goofy humor. My favorite part is the black and white short film on Dodgeball they watch.Sometimes the humor gets a bit silly though. There's a guy who walks around in the film dressed as a pirate for no reason at all. I thought the whole pirate thing was the worst part of the movie. Still, it wasn't enough to tarnish the entire work.I'd recommend checking this out for a rental. Laugh at some parts and not at others. Go with the flow.
__label__2 Good read for CA students wanting to learn about their histo: I'm trying to locate the abridged version that I taught from in the 60s. It's out of print and I would love to get come copies of it if anyone has any to use with my not-so-good readers now.If you find any please call me at 949-854-8889.
__label__1 rating the physical book...not the story: This book is an excellent story. Lots of California history..or better..Alta California as it was known in the era.BEWARE OF THE PHYSICAL BOOK !!!!! It is about 10"x11"...printing of the story is VERY!!!! pale.I will keep this....but have ordered an older, normal paperback version...similar to the one I left accidentally at the San Diego airport.Terrible size and print itself. Find another book of Ramona, by Helen Hunt Jackson....and be ready to want to go to Old Town San Diego.Michaelene Gon.
__label__1 Had to return it.: After I install this blower fan it made a loud ticking sound. So I thought maybe it was hitting something. I uninstalled in and ran the fan uninstalled. It still made the loud ticking noise. So I had to return it. The bad part was that Amazon deducted 7.20 from the price I paid for the fan because I did super saver shipping. I don't recommend buying this fan or any auto parts from Amazon.com since they don't stand behind defective products.
__label__2 Awsome!: I would recommend this product to everybody with a baby in the house. First, it allows you to keep the baby clean, because the bibsters are quite big. Second, they are waterproof and learning to drink out of a cup is always wet. And, third, no washing and a new, clean, spotless bib each time. Makes parenting a bit easier!
__label__2 10 Stars! By far our favorite toy!: This toy is by far our favorite! I don't know how many hours total our son has spent hammering the balls and then watching them go through the maze. Sometimes he uses the hammer, sometimes he just pounds them with his hand. The hammer isn't that hard, so when he does decide to hammer Dad's head, it doesn't hurt that much :-) If your child is less than 1, it will take a few days playing with the toy before he/she masters it and pounds the balls with confidence (they LEARN the toy). If we had 1 toy to take with us on a trip, this would definitely be the one. Highly recommend.
__label__1 WTF ???: Video only?Absolutely no sound from this "NTSC" DVD.I tried it on multiple machines and several computers...No dice...the soundtrack is absent.You have an ideal picture of the artists performing their very silent show.Not very satisfying...I'd rather hear and not see a band than see and not hear a band.just a bit pissed in Puyallup, WA
__label__2 Looking Back with Love: A tantalizing performance by Kathleen Turner. Anyone with a soul sometimes wants to go back in life to discover the great " what if" In this film Peggy Sue gets that chance to possibly change her life by going back ..there!Turner pulls it all off in grand style. The realities she learns are not as profound as she might think they are. Nevertheless , viewing this film might provoke a " thought" journey because its done so well and with care. Watch for Leon Ames and other older stars.Written by Jerry Leichtling and Arlene Sarner.
__label__2 It is like going back in time!: I love this movie...I love it because it lets me go back to 'visit' my Grandmother, who I miss every day of my life. But when I am watching this movie, I am somehow with her again, even if only for a few moments. It also lets me be a 'kid' again...remembering a time long gone by, but never quite forgotten. For me, this is a movie sprinkled with tears but rich with wonderful memories of yesterday. Let's face it, we all would love to go back to a previous time and place, even if just for a moment. This movie is the next best thing.
__label__2 cutting edge: Got these bits a couple of weeks ago to replace a 20+ year old Craftsman set. The first thing I noticed was the heft of the assortment; same number of bits as the Craftsman, but considerably heavier. Have mainly used a couple of the larger ones on a cast iron grill; they chewed through like it was pine. Have used some of the smaller bits to drill out rusted bolts. You only need to watch the metal filings pile up to know they're doing their job. Haven't used any on wood; seems like overkill and my older ones do fine for those. I only wish the storage box had a more positive lock mechanism. But I do like its bright size markings (sure beats stamped metal, which I can never read in weak light). All in all, I'm very pleased, and the price was GREAT!.
__label__2 funny girl: This is a very good movie. It is so easy to be able to order old movies and enjoy them again and again,
__label__1 Do NOT buy this edition of Democracy and Education: This edition of the book is absolutely awful. The type is small and printed in a grayish fuzzy font that is hard to read. The margins are almost nonexistent. There is no space to write notes, not even at the bottom of the page. You will notice that this book is only 194 pages, whereas I recently found a very good used copy that is 378 pages. Both are unabridged, but in this edition the text is crammed onto the pages. Also, just scanning through the book today I quickly found two typos. Avoid this cheaply constructed edition. I sincerely hope Amazon stops selling it.
__label__2 Nice Book: Clean, neat, white,one, made of paper,the cover is shiny,with words,Is anyone getting my pointgood bye
__label__1 Had to buy it: I was forced to buy this for a grad class and it was absolutely boring. I was happy with the price and that's about it.
__label__1 lazy publisher: The edition of "Jude the Obscure" that I believe you're seeing on this page -- the Signet paperback, with the two horses on the cover -- first came out in '61 and hasn't been touched since then (except to add a bibliography in 1980). There is a helpful 11-page afterword by Al Alvarez, but that's it. Signet has just been reissuing and reissuing the same thing for over four decades.With the Signet, though, there are no footnotes; you're just getting the bare text. That means that you'll have zero help with Hardy's rustic or ecclesiastical terms, not to mention the abundant Latin.In short, get this one:Jude the Obscure (Oxford World's Classic), in which said defect is remedied. And unlike the Signet, in which the text has adjusted to reflect modern spelling and pronunciation, the Oxford's World's Classics is Hardy's original text as he saw it published.
__label__1 jude the mundane: thomas harding's overly descriptive writing style backfired in this would be entertaining novel. hardy should've realized that the harsh reception of the novel by the public was probably more because it's boring than because of the controversial text. hardy ruined a perfectly good plot with excessive description and annoying detail.
__label__1 Not an easy read: I didn't enjoy reading this one. I know Hardy isn't the most cheery writer, but this was beyond just depressing -- it was boring. About halfway through, I was tempted to just skip the rest but I trudged on to the bitter end.This may have been scandalous when it was published, but why couldn't Hardy have done a better job with the ending? The almost Dickensian sequence of hard-to-swallow tragedies was too contrived for my taste. Was Hardy afraid of writing a happy ending for this unconventional pair, or did he want to display the worst-case effects of a rigid social code of behavior? Either way, it all became pretty unbelievable.From a historical point of view, as a jumping-off point for a discussion of the social constraints and morals of the period, Jude is a success; it certainly seems to have set off some fireworks when it was first published. As casual reading, I can't recommend it.
__label__1 OK products, HORRIBLE warranty service: If you purchase Millennium products by Farberware do not count on getting any satisfaction if you need to use the warranty. I sent in three pieces 5 months ago for what I was told was a 6-8 week process -- I'm still waiting, and every time I call I get a different line -- they are either incompetent or lying, or both. Decent products, unacceptable customer service -- buyer beware!
__label__2 The Origin of Betty Boop!: Helen Kane is the flapper who was the model for Betty Boop. When you listen to this CD, you can appreciate just how well Mae Questal, who provided the voice of Betty Boop, imitated Helen Kane. The music on this CD is great fun. Not only do you get to hear more complete versions of songs that Betty Boop sings, but there are also songs like "He's So Unusual" that Betty Boop should have sung.
__label__2 works good: Works great now I get the best steamed veggies the company sent it fast I give the company and the steamer 5 star
__label__2 Combo Saucepot and Steamer: Just love this little pot. Have been a Farberware user for over 35 years and finally replaced my 3 quart saucepan with this gem. It's a great size for a small family, doesn't take up much room on the stovetop. Only concern is that the handles do get hot and you need to use a glove or towel to use the handles after boiling or high temps. I would recommend this pot to anyone in the market for mini-size soup/stew preparations.
__label__1 Be careful it's hot, very hot on the handles: I agree this is a solid cookware. But it is so hot on the handles everytime I try to remove it from the stove. I believe they can do something about the design of the handles. BTW, my hands are not so sensitive to heat normally. But this is super hot beyond my tolerance.
__label__2 Great Steamer: Got this mainly for veggies. Works great and fast. Very pleased with it. It could be a little bigger but can hold 4-5 servings.
__label__2 Excellent book!: To tell the truth I was a bit hesitant to purchase this book as loosing my "joy" was not something to which I was willing to admit.John Piper doesn't disappoint. His books are deep which is exactly what I needed as there are just too many superficial books on various Christian topics which tend to lack substance or depth or have any real effect in changing one's heart. John Piper tells it like it is and gets to the heart of the matter.I'm so glad I finally gave in and purchased this book. I have been blessed and I have been able to rediscovered the joy of the Lord that I had when I was first saved.If you can't handle the truth and are not wanting to actually put the time and struggle into what it takes to truly abide with God on a deeper level than this book is not for you. If you are a mature believer who needs a good kick in the pants than this is the book for you. Awesome book! If it is what you need then you will NOT be disappointed!
__label__2 great great great: I WAS LOOKING FOR INEXSPENSIVE HDMI CORDS FOR MY PS3 AND MY NEW HD TV.. WELL EVERYONE TOLD ME U HAVE TO GET MONSTER CABLES THERE LIKE 50$$$ BLAH BLAH BLAH...!!!! WELL I FOUND THESE AND THOUGHT HEY THERE CHEAP SO IF THEY DONT WORK OH WELL.. BOY I WAS WRONG THEY ARE GREAT.. THE TV IS AMAZING AND THE PS3 GAMES LOOK SOOO GOOD!!!.YOU DON'T NEED THOSE OVER PRICED MONSTER CABLES .THEY SHIPPED TO ME FAST.. I EVEN GOT THEM EARLIER THAN EXSPECTED.( I KNOW I WAS CHECKING MY MAIL BOX DAILY) .I WILL DEFINATLY BUY FROM THIS COMPANY AGAIN!!!! THANKS GUYS!!!
__label__1 Very poor quality for HDMI: After two years of using component cables for my Xbox 360, and a year of using a Monster HDMI cable for my PS3, I decided that the difference in quality between the two was noticable enough for me to go out and buy another HDMI cable for my Xbox. After shopping around, and seeing the price and reviews for this cable, I bought it, and in all honesty, this cable is much worse than even my component cables. I tried a few different movies, and a few different games, all to no avail. Characters in my games are choppy, and pixelated, and all of the movies, even in HD quality are blurry. I decided to switch the two cables to see if it was just my Xbox, and immediately noticed the difference. This is a poor cable and I would not reccomend it to anyone who cares about the quality of the graphics on their screen.
__label__2 Works OK but you need extra adaptor if using headset and HDMI for 360.: The HDMI cable works OK with our plasma (someone was asking if was only for LCD before) but if you are using it with your XBOX 360 and you have a headset (Turtle Beach-type, not the regular ones) you'll also need the adaptor for audio OUT. I should have checked before, because the adaptor by itself is more expensive than cable and adaptor together, at least here in Amazon. Otherwise, no problem. Recommended, especially for the price.
__label__2 HDMI Cable: This HDMI Cable category 2 hasn't fail me at all. It works great, and displays up to 1080P! I highly recommend this HDMI cable.
__label__2 Great price--don't buy branded cables: If you can tell the difference between the images and sounds these cables transmit and those transmitted by more expensive cables, you're not likely to be reading reviews of this generic item. These work well for any HDMI connection--don't spend more than a few dollars per cable.
__label__1 Adult who enjoys Good Children's videos: This was very amateurish. Don't think it would hold even the attnetion of a child, no matter what age.
__label__1 The Last Unicorn VHS: Actually I would like the option to give this tape a 0 star rating. I bought this video for my pre-school aged nephews as a Christmas gift. I thought a Rankin Bass video would be good/safe for children. I finally watched it with them the other day. I was very disappointed and would not recommend this movie for anyone. The characters in the story swear. A haggish woman swears at the unicorn saying "Damn you, damn you!" The knight/hero character says "Damn." A troll type creature says something like "What the Hell, am I supposed to look at." and a magician takes God's name in vain after being accosted by a tree he brought to life, which is a buxom "woman tree" who makes a pass at the magician. Shocking. If my nephews went up to their parents and used these expressions from the movie, they would be reprimanded by their parents who do not talk like that. I now know that I need to preview every video I buy for my nephews before giving them a present. Shame on Rankin Bass
__label__1 Can't Manage to think about it...: The Last Unicorn is a TERRIBLE movie, for one the DVD release was very poor, and some aspects of the film weren't made for children...or ANYONE, for that matter. There isn't really a point to this film, so DO NOT BUY IT!
__label__1 The Last Unicorn: If I could give this a half star I would. I bought this for my children to watch and I felt with a rated G rating that I was safe. How wrong I was. I am ashamed to say that I let my children see this before I did. When the magician is tied to the tree and his magic brings the tree to life all I see is the tree and her huge breasts. And the magician is stuck between her cleavage. The world is getting sick enough that I don't need to show a cartoon to my children with this garbage in it. I am highly disappointed and so are my children because they cannot watch this movie. I think that you need to watch this movie first before showing small children.
__label__1 I like Unicorns, but this? Blah!: The last unicorn stinks. You really shouldn't see it. Some people like it, but i think it's a bad movie and doesn't have really good characters. People who like it, like it. We all have different opinions.
__label__1 Great movie, shoddy DVD: The Last Unicorn was my favorite movie when I was a kid. The story is sweet, the animation lovely. I eagerly bought a copy on VHS when I saw it some years ago and awaited the release of the DVD with glee.Unfortunately, my glee was somewhat unfounded. While the movie itself is still as wonderful as ever, the DVD itself is shoddy work. The movie is only presented in fullscreen (though there was a widescreen laser disc available), there are no extras -- even the picture quality is less than outstanding.If you're looking to replace a worn VHS, this is certainly a good option. If, on the other hand, you are waiting for a DVD treatment worthy of this beautiful movie, you have more waiting ahead of you.
__label__1 Fantastic Movie, Worse Transfer Seen DVD: I remember seeing the Last Unicorn when it was first released in the 80's and loved it ever since. The story should keep adults interested throughout, with a wonderful story about dreams, love and sacrifice. The voice acting is first rate as well as the soundtrack. Yet, the transfer onto DVD is the worst I've even seen, the opening titles are blurry, the picture fuzzy. One review questioned that it may have came from the master VHS. I would not even go that far, it's a very poor copy, as for the sound, if you have 5.1 surround, you'll hear music and the voices coming from all directions. I view my movies on a HDTV, and that's even no help. As for extras, there are none, not even a trailer. So should you get it? Its nice to have it added to my collection, but expect a poor VHS viewing vice the clear DVD.
__label__2 Fantasy or reality: I have always loved this movie and was so excited to learn it was on DVD finally. A wonderful cast and wonderful music. I could watch it again and again. I love it.
__label__2 A Truly Beautiful Film!: When I was about four or five years old I loved to watch The Last Unicorn. Spotting it at Blockbuster, I decided to rent it, wondering how I would see it now.I was worried when I saw that the animation was Rankin/Bass, but in the end I found it to be a visual confection.Some of the characters do look a little cheesy, but most of the time the animation dazzled me. In particular Mommy Fortuna's tree stump hat is very cool, forestscapes are ethereal, and I love Molly's BIG brown eyes.My favorite scene is the meeting of Molly and the Unicorn...The woman is angered that the Unicorn came to her at a low point in her life rather than when she was "new and innocent." After that schpiel Molly embraces her and whispers, "I forgive you."To my mind, this is one of those works like The Little Prince or The Mouse and His Child that is meant for chidren but is sincere enough to captivate adults as well. Well done.
__label__1 Possibly the worst DVD transfer I've ever seen: First things first: This is a nice movie for kids, particularly little girls. The story is compelling, though the animation is pretty lousy. The music, written by the estimable Jimmy Webb and sung by America, is quite good. I'd give the movie 3 stars on the whole, 4 stars for a little girl.Now for this particular DVD. It's absolutely attrocious! The picture looks no better than an average VHS cassette. Worse (MUCH worse), the soundtrack suffers from noticable pitch inconsistencies. It sounds like a dub from a BAD cassette tape. There is no excuse for this, and I've never seen (or heard) a poorer DVD transfer.If you already own this movie on VHS, there's no reason to spend any money to get his version. It's surely no better than the copy you have, and is (because of the soundtrack wow and flutter) arguably worse.
__label__2 Untitled: I love this movie so much. I have been watching it for years and I have yet to grow tired of it. It is a great movie with beautiful songs and music. The story-line will capture you. This is definately one of MY favorite movies.
__label__2 Good movie: This is a great movie! I first saw it when I was about 6 and I still love it! Beware of the profanity! I recently saw it again and I was surprised to hear the bad language because of the G rating.
__label__2 AN ALL TIME CLASSIC: People of all ages love this story. It is currently a movie and a book and both are equally fantastic. The Last Unicorn has been my favorite movie for as long as I can remeber. This movie will never leave you stranded. It has all the elements a fantasy story should have. Buy it while you can because this movie will remain for years to come and the longer you wait the more expensive it will be. This movie is a true classic.
__label__2 Next best thing to being in a Chicago blues club: Not sure why I added this one to my large collection but it is now one of my favorites. My biggest regret is not getting to see him live before he died. Unlike some CDs where there is only one or 2 good songs this one has lots of great songs.
__label__1 Yet another version, another vocalist.: The sound musically is good. That's the only reason I give it one star. But for the vocals no stars. If you don't care who sings, then buy it. I regret buying this cd, because the vocals don't appeal to me. Take advantage of the "Listen to" songs when available. Unfortunately on this cd that option is not available. But many others do have it.
__label__2 Awesome drum for a crappy drummer.: This drum is sweet. It looks amazing coming out of the box, a classic, beautiful design. I swapped the stock Weather Master heads for an Emperor Coated/ Clear Ambassador Reso. Also swapped stock snares for 42-strand wires. No complaints about sound from this beauty.My only complaint to date is the strainer. The standard P-85 strainer would often get snagged when moving the snares from off to on. This sucks big time when you're in the middle of a song, fighting with the strainer to co-operate. I got desperate and almost snapped the arm off it once. This may have been a problem on my end, seating it incorrectly or something. I'll soon swap to a P-86 strainer.Also, watch out for fingerprints on this! The chrome looks awesome when it's clean, however fingerprints really stand out.. and drive me mad. Minor detail but thought it was worth mentioning.Overall, very good drum. If mine got stolen or destroyed in a fire I would buy another.
__label__2 One glaring omission, one glaringly bad inclusion: What were they thinking when they put this collection together? Yes, it has almost - ALMOST - all of Elvis's greatest hits but where is "One Night"? And why, why, why would they dare to include Elvis's horrendous live version of "Polk Salad Annie" and omit a classic like "One Night"? It is for that glaring omission and that glaringly bad inclusion that I give this collection a rating of 4 rather than 5. Hey, I love Elvis Presley's music as much as anyone but he had no business recording "Polk Salad Annie." There's only one version of that song that should ever be heard and that's the original by the song's writer, Tony Joe White.
__label__2 A book for the ages: I mistakenly checked this book out of the library when I was in 4th grade (1964), thinking it was going to be about knights ("The Silver Sword"). Imagine my surprise when, upon reading the first page, I discovered it was about a young boy (my age) separated from his family during WWII. Yet, even that first page sucked me in. I was not an avid, or even a good reader at that age, but I couldn't put it down, and finished the book in two days. I proceeded to check it out at least once a year until I could no longer find it in libraries. It was probably the single biggest reason I learned to love reading. My son is now in 4th grade, and I logged on to see if I could find it, and will make sure it becomes a part of his life as well.
__label__1 No Joy Here: The site of an immaculately turned out Susan Hampshire in thick eyeliner and gleaming white (flared) trouser suit prancing through the Serengeti should serve as an immediate red flag. This is about as far as you can get from Bill Travers' and Virginia McKenna's charming performances in Born Free, never mind invoking the real Adamsons, who led interesting and ultimately tragic lives. Doesn't seem much like Kenya in the fifties to me (I was there). Give it a miss.
__label__1 Disappointing!: This Born Free sequel lacks authenticity (the two leads show a loving relationship, when the opposite is well-known) and credibility (how in the world could the three young cubs shown have survived on their own for as long as they supposedly did?). It's also boring.
__label__2 Mini Shuttle Astronaut: I love this item! It occupies the top shelf of my "sci-fi shrine" next to my tiny Star Trek models.
__label__2 Born Free!: This film is great for family! I watched online through Amazon Prime and it played perfect and was so crystal clear! I recommend this movie for all families!This movie will make you laugh and cry it is that Great! I will order this DVD through Amazon.com soon and add it to my library! This movie is also educational for everyone!I Just Love all Cats, wild or tame! I have my own domestic cat called Snowy, he is 8 years old now and mostly all white with a little apricot on his ears and tail, he also has light blue eyes! Cats Rule, Dogs Drool!! Sorry I am just kidding, I like all animals!
__label__2 BORN FREE: THIS IS AN EXCELLENT MOVIE, THE QUALITY IS NOT AS GOOD AS IT SHOULD BE,BUT ITS GREAT TO WATCH AFTER ALL THESE YEARS
__label__2 THE FAMILY UNDER THE BRIDGE: THIS BOOK HAD GREAT CHARACTERS AND PLOT. IT TOOK PLACE IN PARIS,FRANCE. IT IS ABOUT A FAMILY WITHOUT A HOME. MY FAVORITE CHARACTER IS ARMAND, THE TRAMP.THE ILLUSTRATIONS REALLY ADDED TO THE STORY. I CAN SEE WHY IT WON A NEWBERRY MEDAL. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO EVERYONE.
__label__1 Cute story with difficult vocabulary for kids: This book, set in Paris in late December follows a hobo named Armand, who's gruff on the outside, but reveals his inner warmth when he finds a newly homeless family living under "his" bridge. While this book does have many good points, this isn't a book I would recommend. The story would be very entertaining to a fifth grader but the vocabulary skills and difficulty understanding Paris or gypsies would frustrate a reader in this age group. A sixth grader, however, would more easily comprehend the vocabulary (I admit that I didn't know many of the words and had to guess at their meaning in context--and I don't consider my vocabulary skills poor by any means) and cultural situations but they would be bored by the simplistic story. In all, I would not recommend it not because it is a bad book, but because I think there are better choices out there.
__label__2 The Family Under the Bridge: This book, The Family Under the Bridge, is about an old hobo named Armand. He and a family live in Paris.Armand the old hobo pushed all of his belongings around in an old baby buggy, that had no hood.One day Armand took the Calcet children, Suzy, Paul, & Evelyne to see Father Christmas.A whilr later, Armand took the children and their mother to a gypsy camp where they lived for a few days. But then the gypsys moved away and they were again homeless.And because Armand loved the children so much he got a job at the Halles. And while he was there he could picture the wholr family sitting and playing in the house.And until then they have lived happily ever after.
__label__2 Mitford Years ammended: Very fast response to my request. Excellent condition of the book. Would heartily recommend.
__label__1 Disappointed: I was very disappointed in this book. She seems to have gotten bored with her characters. I have loved all the previous books, but it seems like someone forced her to write this one. Very disappointing. Very disjointed.
__label__2 Perfect: Thank you for the prompt delivery and the book arrived in the described condition. The book was great and I really love the whole series.
__label__2 Absolutely the BEST: I have worn NARS Sunset Strip lip gloss for over 8 years and still continue to get compliments on the color. I have tried all the other major brands, Dior, La Prairie, Laura Mercier and Bobby Brown to name a few and nothing begins to compare. The color saturation is perfect and the formula is great without being too sticky. Many brands do not stay put, but the NARS is always there. I think the one major difference is that I always use a lip pencil first,, this helps to intensify the color and hold the gloss on the lip. Unfortunately I have been informed that they are discontinuing this color, but they have a new one called wonder that looks similar. Anyway, regardless of the color, I highly recommend NARS lipgloss.
__label__2 Better than expected: My foot doc recommended I use this first instead of going in for surgery for a bunion. He told me to wear it for at least 3 months at night. So far, it's been about 3 months, and I do see a minimal difference with the severity of the bunion. I can wear a pair of narrow shoes now that I previously could not. It's not an overnight cure, but I would recommend this for anyone with a Stage 1 bunion issue. It looks cheap, but it's surprisingly durable! It may feel a bit uncomfortable for the first few nights, but you get used to it.
__label__1 The shadows between: The poltergiest: The Legacy book The Shadows Between left me in the dark. Even through the story was interesting to read I had to real follow the plot carefully. The story start with the appearance of a man, David Carson arriving at The Legacy House. Who he is and where he came from is discovered as the story moves on in the book. I am a fan of the series and the books except for this one. It was slow going and for one to understand what is happenning in the story you have to read very carefully or read it a second time. I did enjoy reading the other books in the series but "The Shadows Between" left me confused about what was going on. Sorry.
__label__2 Wonderful book!: I use this book because I am under a doctor's care and have to track my food intake and exercise daily. I'm also supposed to take notes on how I feel physically each day. I was happy to find a book that included everything I needed. It's the first one I've found and I've been doing this for a while. I also write my medications down on the journal page after I take them and have them all listed in the front. That way in case of emergency the crew would know what I take. I carry this book in my purse and love it.
__label__2 Streisand at her comic best: This was Barbra Streisand's first non singing role, but her performance is pure musical-comedy. She is hilariously funny! She also has a very good chemistry with co-star, George Segal. With a truly witty script by Buck Henry, they make a great pair. This is a very funny movie, and makes a great showcase for Ms. Streisand's comedic flair. Her fans will love it, and those who aren't fans? Hey, she'll win you over. Have a great time watching!
__label__1 Warning - misleading listing: This item is advertised as being the R-rated (original) version. It is not! It is the reissued (and censored) GP-13 version which is not nearly as good or as funny.The listing should be corrected and we can only hope that one day the studio will release the DVD in its original version.
__label__2 Anamorphic Widescreen: This imported DVD has a nice picture. It comes in the original aspect ratio of approximately 1:85 anamorphic widescreen. The audio is in Dolby Digital Mono and has Korean, Spanish, English and Italian subtittles. Buy it while you can because this movie is not available in DVD in the United States.
__label__1 Okay!: I was about 16 years old when this movie was in the movie theaters and being a fan of Brooke Shields I watched Endless Love and I actually liked it but unfortunately I let some people convince me that it wasn't a good movie to like but now that I'm older I find that I like this movie again and think it was good so I'm editing an older review that I wrote in which I gave it a low rating of two stars but I now would rate it 3 1/2 stars.
__label__1 misrepresented usefulness: Book was advertised to help with any type of writing. It is not. It is only useful for improving the writing of articles, ie. newspaper, mag. etc.
__label__2 The Slipper and the Rose: Finally,it's going to happen on April 25,2000. I just couldn't believe that a video of one of the best musicals ever made didn't exist. My daughter and I recorded it years ago when she was little and we have watched it over and over for years. You have to get this movie just for the songs which were nominated for the Academy Awards. This movie is destined to become an all time classic. Now, many more people will get to experience the best Cinderella story of all. It's been long overdue.
__label__1 Caution with this supplier: this product is ok however, unlike the discription claims it is not easy to cut, even with new sharp tools, the seets that I recieved tend to be very hard almost like Lenoleum tile for your floor, but even harder serface then even those. Either the product some where got exposed to extreame heat or its old.
__label__1 All show, no go.: The key word in the title is "unique." I'll give it that. I'm sure the contents pass muster as "art," and in that regard, I know what I like; this ain't it. Most of these tracks take forever to go anywhere and sound like Chip Davis & Co. have just discovered synthesizers and looping software. The only really listenable track is "Zip-A-Dee-Doo-Dah", which establishes fairly quickly and at least sounds like the song it's supposed to be. Even it, along with most of the others, is a study in "Hey, Mom, watch this!" sound effects generation unworthy of either the Disney moniker or Mannheim Steamroller. "When You Wish Upon A Star" tangled up with "Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star" - with neither really coming to the fore - borders on insulting; Jiminy Cricket would not be happy! Unless you're a fan of early Moog experiments, pass on this one.
__label__2 Correction of author: author is Arloc Sherman: As can be found on eric.ed.gov and cbpp.org, and in this review at the Harvard Educational Review ([...]), the correct author of this book is Arloc Sherman.Marian Wright Edelman, a highly noted scholar and activist for children, wrote the Introduction, while Robert M. Solow wrote the Foreword.
__label__2 A kitchen staple: I love this pan. I use it practically every day. We received one for our marriage, and, after 20 years, I finally had to replace it. (A second one we received a few years later is still holding up beautifully.) The pan is the perfect size for a can of soup or vegetables or a gravy mix. I absolutely love it!
__label__2 great movie: I live In Rutherford County and my husband worked for Damon Huskey on which the movie is based. Some of the things were a little far fetched but all in all is depicted as he lived.The Part of the movie of the 3 officers that were killed was based on actual events as it took place on that horrible evening May 31st 1979.My husband was working that day and spend hours in the woods looking for the shooter.So far this movie has only been available on VHS and would love to see it on DVD.But it is worth watching to see how a country sheriff did all that was expected of him and then some.Kind of like Buford Pusser in "Walking tall" but he didn't carry a big stick just a big gun.
__label__2 I believe he is right: Stanley Tam believed in principles and in his faith. His story is truly amazing and his success cannot be disputed. Regardless of your faith or lack thereof the author does a great job in humbly recapping his lifetime achievements for our benefit. Give him a chance to tell you his story. I believe only good things will come of it.
__label__2 remarkable!!!: I love this cd. My favorite song is "Gills and Tails." I have been following her music since she was with Groove Theory. True talent. She is soooooooooooo under rated. KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK AMEL!!!!
__label__1 A huge Adams fan finally must face reality.: As a long-time Douglas Adams fanatic (read all 5 of the trilogy, at least a dozen time, even wrote down every noun in all 5 for a database,) I read both Last Chance to See and DGHDA and loved them. Then I read this sequel and had to admit that it was likely the worst book I'd ever encountered. I didn't laugh once and literally had to force myself through it with several lapses between readings. Odin and Thor bored me senseless. I can now understand why there's been no third addition to the series. Time wasted on this could have been much better spent working on yet another HHG novel.
__label__2 Gods walk among us: This is the 2nd Dirk Gently novel and like the first it is good fun , with Adams trademark sense of humour. An explosion at Heathrow is called by the press an Act of God, and it turns out to be more than tabloid hyberbole, as Dirk Gently soon discovers.The feel of the novel is reminiscient of Thorne Smith's 'The Night Life of the Gods'. But although Adam's style is always enjoyable, the novel seems a little thin; all wit and little substance. Given Adams notorious bouts with writer's block maybe his publishers were unwilling to wait for it to be properly polished.
__label__1 Boring: I had read somewhere that this foreign(german i think) slasher flick was good...so I rented it(thank goodness I did'nt buy it) and was really disapointed. The dubbing is bad and the plot is so unoriginal. Basically a maniac escapes from an aslyum who likes to kill people with big scissors-at the same time, some teenagers decide to party in a spooky old school where they just graduated from. There is alot of running around, people crawling through air vents, and of course stabbings. It isn't even gory if you're into that sorta thing and the beginning, which is like a rip-off of Scream is just plain silly....Skip this one or rent it if you have insomnia...
__label__1 you have got to be kidding me: I am absolutely appalled and saddened to see a book with this title.I've been lost in the 'Alzheimer' labyrinth for the past decade.I have no need for a condescending book of this ilk.The title alone makes me want to vomit.Shame on the authors and anyone associated with it.Alzheimer's Disease is too complex a disease for a 'Dummies' manual.This deeply disturbs me.~m
__label__1 Sucked: I should have known that a Van Damme movie would not be worth the time or money. It simply sucked.
__label__1 Poor quality product: After 2nd or 3rd usage, inside of the pots started to tarnished (not a food stain). Now the food cooked using these tarnished pots are tasting bit bitter (metallic taste). Very poor quality product.
__label__2 Amazing bargain for the quality: I love this cookware! I had to leave my old kitchen things behind when I moved suddenly last fall due to illness and had gotten some cheap crud at Wal-Mart. BIG MISTAKE. After just 5 months it was a mess, so I went looking at Amazon, Target, and a bunch of other sites. This set was the best bargain and the highest quality I could afford and I could not be much happier with it. The bottoms are heavy and not only retain heat but distribute it evenly. I've only scorched one dish since getting the set and that was my fault, not the cookware. I will be adding other pieces from this line to my collection. Recommended.
__label__2 Great!: I really love this pot. It's a bit larger than I expected, but that's my fault for not researching the size of pots properly. I'm just cooking for myself so 6 quarts is a bit more than needed. Regardless, even when I cook small amounts of things, the food doesn't burn or stick horrifically - this pot conducts heat well and is nice and heavy bottomed. It's easy to clean and I would recommend this pot.
__label__2 For the price, can't beat ths cookware: I bought my first set 30+ years ago and finally walked away from my big kettle and burned it dry (sucks getting old). The product has not changed in that time because its great!
__label__2 Perfection!: I love these guys! Finally, a comedy based on my generation and humor. These guys aren't afraid to put it out there or say whatever is on their minds. If you like silly, stupid, raunchy; then this show is for you.
__label__1 Finding unworthy research to support questionable conclusions: It's widely reported that the religious right makes up a little less than 40% of the Republican party...not exactly a controlling majority. To imply that they are driving all policy towards a theocracy is intellectually dishonest, but works as a great scare tactic.Please, look at some of the sources used in the research. To say that they lack credibility would be an understatement (Air America, etc?). But, books that are preaching to the choir are a dime-a-dozen these days. The author has his select audience and he's trying to give him what they want to hear and shaping the research to support his conclusions. There's nothing wrong with that, it sells books, just don't expect many of the arguments to hold water.
__label__2 Excellent!: This book is very well written and researched. It is obvious that the negative reviewers on this site are the radical religious extremists that it is written about.
__label__2 Wow.: Even if you know a lot of this stuff, it's bracing (to say the least) to see it all presented at once. It's the kind of book that may permanently taint your view of the future, and/or get you to start making worst-case-scenario plans in the event that "all the wheels come off at once".Especially interesting were the chapters on the history of "mainstream" and "outsider" churches in the US over the past two centuries (definitely a neglected topic, as the author points out) and the "southernization" of America. If Mr. Phillips' sterling credentials and decidedly non-left orientation aren't enough to convince you that this isn't a biased, one-sided polemic, you're probably unreachable.
__label__1 Super-awful: It gets two stars for the unintentional comedy. Other than that, it's one of the worst of the ultra-cheesy, predictable, low-budget horror movies from the early nineties. The FX are funny at first, but then they just go on and on and on and the sucking takes over from the comedy. The acting is uniformly terrible, and one has to image that the typically enjoyable Barrymore is just glad to have this ridiculous part of her career well behind her.
__label__1 poor quality: I purchased this from renovaters supply in March 2005. The rod itself is made of solid brass tubing which is why I purchased this. However, the wall of the tubing is made from incredibly thin brass and will bend if you hang a wet towel on it. The chrome plating is also of poor quality. For $100, you would think this would be top quality. Don't waste your money on this item.
__label__2 I've got the ice in me.: Considering that Enemymine is the work of Zack Sally, Danny Sasaki and Mike Kunka you might wonder how a double bass - one drummer band works. The answer is heavy and quite well. This EP contains my favorite song by Enemymine: I've Got the Ice in Me. However, the EP is quite heavy and the sounds that Kunka and Sally create with their basses is incredible. Sadly, like godheadSilo, Enemymine was not all that well known. If you are interested in Dead Low Tide or Smoke and Smoke give Enemymine (and godheadSilo) a try.
__label__1 How not to write a book!: This is easily the greatest example any teacher/professor could use in teaching how NOT to write a book.It's clearly a novel, full of exaggeration, distortion,and in many places complete lies.May God have had mercy when Loraine tried explaining his part in his false witness crusade against the the Church, our 2000 year old Catholic Church!
__label__1 Eye opening: It's amazing how gullible some people can be.I bought and read this book when I was evangelical.I then began to examine the issues in it, and, seeing not only the inaccuracies and misrepresentations in this book, but also seeing the historical, theological and BIBLICAL cohesion of the claims of the Catholic Church, I became Catholic.Need I say more?
__label__1 Rule#1: Just because it's published doesn't mean it's true.: This one of the worst abominations ever put in print to "describe" Catholicism. It is of note only for its ludicrous claims, half-truths, and outright lies. DON'T BE FOOLED: THIS TEXT IS NOTHING MORE THAN RUN-OF-THE-MILL, PITIFULLY IGNORANT ANTI-CATHOLICISM AT ITS WORST.It has value only as an example of atrocious scholarship, flagrant misrepresentation, and outright bigotry.
__label__1 A codex of garbage: This book is without question a codex of lies from someone who hates the Catholic Church. The truly sad part is that some people actually eschew the Bible in order to support Boettner's rancid work.The book is useful for Catholic apologists to understand the genesis of some of the more laughable arguments made against Catholicism.As a source of honest information, it's a sad joke. A sad joke that still infects some of the more naive minds out there.
__label__1 Outrageous pack of lies: As a former protestant turned Catholic, I have done substantial research myself into the doctrinal basis of Catholic Church teaching. And my conclusion: this book is at best an example of poor scholarship.......but is probably more likely a deliberate attempt to spread anti-Catholic propaganda to unknowing protestants. If you want the TRUTH about Catholic Church doctrine, better to read Karl Keating's "Catholicism and Fundamentalism" or Alan Schreck's "Catholic and Christian". If you are gonna disagree with Catholic Church doctrine, at least know what the actual doctrine IS!!!
__label__1 No understanding of the Catholic Church: The author displays a complete disregard for the teachings of the Catholic Church (either pre-Vatican II or post-Vatican II)and instead offers recycled stereotypical nonsense of Catholicism offered by the same pseudo-religious Protestant preachers who seek to discredit the Church.One might actually gain a better knowledge of the Catholic Church by reading:a) The Bibleb) The Catechism of the Catholic Church(Something that the author of this book has obviously not done)
__label__1 May God have mercy on you, seriously!: Wow, what can I say? Totally ignorant, very very poorly done or just plain intentional lies to mislead people. Even those people who don't have any faith affiliations and atheists will find this book beyond poorly researched.I totally get it if one's own or other christian denomination's interpretation of the Bible is different from Roman Catholism and her teachings but when people (especially this book) intentionally MISREPRESENTS, fabricate lies that the other Church TRULY teaches, it borders bigotry and hatred which is against the 9th Commandment of God, "Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor".Please for humanity's sake.....read a lot of good historical books specially the other's side OFFICIAL teachings and not just from some disgruntled priest, nun or unverifiable source and lastly....be honest!
__label__1 A Good Fantasy: Mr Boettner's book has absolutely no basis in the real world. I think it is safe to say there are factual errors on nearly every page, and even when he does get it right, he often distorts the facts. Catholics should read this just to see how far anti-catholics will go!
__label__1 Good idea that fails in implementation: I originally was quite interested in seeing this film after reading a lot of good press about it. When I finally did see the film theatrically I mainly saw little more than the failed possibilities.In my opinion the greatest weakness is in focus. The two founders are not particularly interesting characters and the choice to focus on them to the exclusion of the company itself brought the film down. As well there are significant time gaps in the growth of govWorks.com while other sections (most notably the rather boring part about securing venture capital) are given a disproportionate share of the time. In the end I never was able to care about the characters or gain any real feeling for the company they founded. It could have been about any other business that failed with very little that was specific to the time, place, or culture that surrounded the Dot-Com Boom and why it went bust.

__label__2 A wonderful story: Joel Vance does a wonderful job of drawing you into his hunting life, and painting a word-picture that makes you feel like you're there. He has an easy-going writing style, so it's fun to ride along as he tells his tales. There are times when you'll laugh out loud, and others when you'll find good, solid information about hunting, guns or dogs.
__label__1 Not good enough: I like David and have seen him live. The beginning of this book was pretty good, but then I just lost interest. There were the occasional laugh out loud sections, but it seemed like they weren't coming often enough to keep me choosing this book over others. So I say it just wasn't good enough.
__label__1 Made me feel icky: I recently bought Sedaris' Carnegie Hall CD and thought it was hilarious. I am also an enthusiastic fan of This American Life and have loved his many contributions. This book proves that NPR highlights Sedaris' best work and leaves the rest. Unfortunately this is a book mostly of "the rest".I had a tough time finding any redeeming value in the story of his rickshaw hauling, trash picking sister and her ability to put out cigarettes with her bare feet. I was much more repulsed by the story of his budding homosexuality and the way he was able to coerce young, naked boys to sit on his lap.If I were to choose one word to describe this book it would be "icky". Skip the ickiness and buy the CD. Or, better yet skip the expense and listen to This American Life. It's free and it's his best material.
__label__2 A good buy for Sedaris fans, but mostly available elsewhere: I love David Sedaris. I think his writing is very funny, very touching and very entertaining. I go to see Sedaris speak when he's on tour and I read short pieces he's written for The New Yorker and Esquire online. In fact, I've already read many of the stories in this book (which was somewhat disappointing). "Rooster at the Hitching Post" and several other have been printed elsewhere and you can read them online if you don't want to buy this book. I will say, though, there are plenty of new stories in here that make the book well worth it. Just don't be too surprised if you come across something you've read before.
__label__2 Something more serious: If you enjoyed "Me Talk Pretty One Day" then you will like this book. Although it is a little more serious... with personal stories from Sedars' struggles in life. But it still has laugh out loud situations.I listened to both books, read by the author, which made the stories feel even more personal.
__label__2 Rolling on the floor in a fit of laughter: Being the first David Sedaris book I've ever picked up, I didn't quite know what to think when I first checked it out from the library. But after hearing it raved about by my friends and being highly allured by the cover, I decided to give it a try. Reading this book turned out to be one of the most rewarding experiences I've had in a very long time. I found myself cracking up at stories like "Six to Eight Black Men", "Baby Einstein" and "Monie Changes Everything." I often laughed so hard I received very curious stares from those around me.David Sedaris is not only hilarious and entertaining, but also a very talented writer who knows how to weave a story unlike any others. I highly, highly, as highly as anyone can, recommend this book for someone, anyone who needs a good laugh.
__label__1 A literary reality show?: Sedaris' book is entirely too self-aggrandizing to rate as entertainment. Spare yourself from the temptation to buy.Lamar Nesbit
__label__1 Random rantings from a drugged homosexual: The wittiest parts are in the first 3 chapters. Other than that, don't bother. This is the sad story of the product of a dysfunctional, estranged family who has many opportunities through gifts, trusts and other money sources to find his potential, get an education and make his contribution to society. Instead, through drugs, homosexuality and extreme self-absorbtion, he descends into a sad, wasted life. I regret buying this book. Again, don't bother.
__label__2 Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim: Hearfelt essays on David Sedaris' life growing up gay in middle America. Always full of astute observations of American life, you will laugh out loud many times while reading this collection of essays.
__label__1 good pan, just hope you don't need the lifetime warranty: good pan, just hope you don't need the lifetime warranty. this complaint is not pan specific. If you have read the tons of consumer complaints against Meyer corp you will see that they do NOT honor there lifetime warranty on the non stick surface. I had my pan for 2 years and the surface stopped working. we have never used the pan in the oven, nor put it in the dish washer and we don't even own anything but plastic pan utensils. all of which makes our pan a perfect candidate to be replaced. according to the website, you don't need an RMA or anything just UPS the pan. well i did. the UPS tracking shows them getting it some 4 months ago and no word from them. after checking around on line, this is typical of them. save your $10 in UPS shipping and buy a different brand. vote with your dollar and spend it else ware.
__label__2 Farberware classic 10 inch frying pan: I've used Farberware for 40 years and have always loved their products. Most of my pots still look great after so much use. They cook food beautifully. The only problem has been with some of the handles loosening up after years of use. They can usually be tightened with a screwdriver, but after a long while, it's a bit more difficult.
__label__2 Fantastic: I sent this collection of Italian cheeses to my daughter and needless to say she was delighted. They were excellent!!Formaggio del Cucina (Italian Cooking Cheeses 2 pound) by igourmet.com
__label__1 It didn't help my vision: I followed this book and did everything it said with an open mind. The print is every bit as blurry as it every was before I tried the things in this book. I wanted so much for this to work, and I'll try again, but after four months of daily applying the techiniques of this book, my vision did not improve the least bit.
__label__2 Terrific Album but what happened to 4 Strong Winds?: I saw the Heart of Gold concert from the Ryman Aud. on Showtime recently and found the music and staging superb.Neil sounded great and his asides between numbers showed how sensitive a performer he really is to those in his audience. I immediately ordered the Prarie Winds CD as well as the DVD. However I was disappointed that Four Strong Winds was not included on the CD. This is a beautiful song by Ian Tyson also found on CASH -V by Johnny Cash. I would hope that Neil's version will eventually make it to a CD in the future. I recommend both to all Neil's fans.
__label__1 Great music, terrible recording/sound quality: The recording is so bass heavy that it is not pleasurable to listen to. The music on this CD is also on the live "Heart of Gold" DVD movie...the sound quality is quite good on the live recording. Mr. Young's performance of the songs is also better on the live recording.
__label__1 Prairie Wind review: The CD does not play. I have tried it in several different CD players and it simply doesn't play. The Johnny Cash CD I purchased with it plays just fine, so I don't know why it doesn't work. I would appreciate a replacement.
__label__1 Buy Neil's Greatest Hits Insted: I don't think this is Neil Young's best CD. I look at the radiobut the Painter gets played like 2,695 times on the radio a day.Why? Plus I've heard the songs are too slow. This is too muchof an overrated CD! Buy the last album from Neil Young, GreatestHits it has better songs like his best, Down by the River, andthe great grunge, Hey Hey, My My. This is a waste of money.
__label__1 Lost in stereotypes: A decent book that could have been great, Homes's novel came off underbaked. Too many implausible plot lines that are hastily tossed in, incomplete, cookie-cutter characters, and a seeming desire on the part of the author to recreate the Los Angeles of "L.A. Story" sabotage an otherwise compelling story of a man who is trying to find his life again.Were this story focused on its characters more and their actual issues instead of attempting to impress readers with the flash and bang of its irrelevant events, this would have been a much more interesting book. Even the book's title suggests that Homes did not have a clear grasp on the point of this novel, and she spends 384 pages wandering around the desert trying to find it.
__label__1 If you like reading for the sake of reading...: Ultimately, this book is frustrating. It drones on like our own mundane lives, except the characters in the book are unbelievable. Everyone is an exaggeration. Too rich, too full of themselves, too over the top, too self serving.The conversations are all meaningless, except maybe the one where Richard's son tells him how he feels about their relationship.Even the ending of the book is unresolved and open ended.If you like reading for the sake of reading, I recommend it. If you're looking for inspiration to change your life, do what the hero did... walk out your door and open your eyes...
__label__1 Misguided Purchase: The photo and description do not reflect the product. The screen panel kit I received was white. What a huge inconvenience during a time-crunch.
__label__1 Not as shown: This product is shown in its picture setup with a top. There is no top with this product and there are no supports or framework of any kind to set it up with. What you get is a white folded cloth in a bag.
__label__1 No plot: The story plot of this movie sucked. It started going on a boat trip it ended going back on the same boat trip. She was in this time still world that she kept re-livin. The question is WHY. The movie did not give a reason. What happened to make her go into this state. It started in the time still state and ended the same way. I will never watch this movie again. I gave it one star because that is lowest grade I can go.
__label__1 B movie: The movie was kind of low budget and more like a college film class movie/project than anything. Some disconnects in it where the story didn't make sense. The overall concept was interesting, using greek myth to drive the theme. B movie when you're bored.
__label__1 Ewwwww...: What the hell? Weird and beyond disturbing. I had trouble figuring this one out. Didn't care for this one at all.
__label__2 Excellent (no spoilers): Only this and 'Sherlock Holmes' were grabbing my interest on the new Video On Demand releases. I was afraid this was going to be a slasher flick. I'm so glad I picked 'Triangle'. I haven't been this freaked out by a movie in a long time. There's truly some memorable scenes and one that gave me goose bumps towards the end. Superb directing, the atmosphere was just fantastic. Melissa George really showed her acting potential here, although I only have one other movie to compare to. And I'm like, who are these other actors? Surely one of them is going to completely bring the movie down in some way. Absolutely not. Solid acting all around. If you dig 'Twilight Zone' or just like freaky movies that make you think afterwards, you can't go wrong with this gem.
__label__2 stealth movie: a movie that sneaks up on you. not a big budget. but an excellent film.and i like excellent films.
__label__1 Don't waste your time: The plot and acting for this movie are terrible. The conclusion doesn't make any sense. I watched this movie because of the positive reviews. After watching the movie, I wonder if the positive reviewers were paid to review this movie. It is very frusterating to watch because the main character continues to make the same mistakes over and over again. The ending brings no closure. Spoiler: The beginning is the ending and the ending is the beginning. I suppose the writer thought it would be witty but it is just a ridiculous plot.
__label__1 Poorly researched, this book is a must-NOT Read.: No one is perfect but a non-fiction is no use if you cannot trust the accuracy of the information in it. In Mistresses of Mayhem, Ms. Hornberger makes mistakes so blatant that it calls the whole book into question. One wonders if she did any research at all or just read up on the criminals on the Court Tv Website. She misnames Countess Elizabeth Bathory (the so-called female Dracula) as Bathroy. (No it is not a typo. It is spelled that way all through the book.) In the famous Diane Downs case already well documented by Ann Rule in Small Sacrifices and made into a tv movie seen by many, she misidentifies the daughter who died as Christie who might be surprised by this since Christie not only survived but testified against her mother. (Cheryl is the daughter who died but Hornberger describes Cheryl as testifying at the trial.) Simple proofreading could have corrected these mistakes. Good research would have made proofreading and this review unnecessary.
__label__1 very poor quality: I am surprised at so many positive reviews. The prose in this book is very poor quality, it's simplistic, repeptitive and many times plain silly. It reads like a quick amateur effort. While I think that the autor is entitled to the right to fictionalize some characters or events, i can't understand why her language is so dismal.
__label__2 trashy, but quick and entertaining: I wouldnt call this a literary masterpiece or the best book that I have ever read, but I found it to be one of the most demanding--that I go back to it and finish as soon as possible!It's one of those literary candy novels that you can't put down. You will be up at night trying to find out who is sleeping with whom and killing whom next...The amount of sex in the book (without too much graphic detail) is numbing afterwards. It's almost as mundane as brushing one's teeth, after reading hundreds of pages on the role that sex plays in politics, weath, class, manipulation, etc.A harlequin story.Unbelievable society that Tudor was.So glad that women have it much better these days.The PILL did change history!
__label__2 Couldn't put it down!: I bought this book as an assignment for my moms' book club. I could NOT put it down! If my history books had been this interesting in high school, I probably would have considered majoring in history in college! Gregory's writing is absolutely delicious. She enhances the historical facts with dialogue and really gives you a sense of how these characters lived and interacted. Now I am completely fascinated by historical novels. Another recommendation from my book club is Abundance, about Marie Antoinette. (Even if you don't read it, please know that Marie is NOT the one who said "Let them eat cake!" That infamous quote was actually uttered by a man and incorrectly attributed to her. She actually loved the French people.) Anyway, this novel is much better than the movie "The Other Boleyn Girl," which I did see, so if you saw the movie you should still read this book to really get the details of the story!
__label__2 The Other Boleyn Girl: This is one of the best pieces of historical fiction that I have read. Very hard to put down, the story keeps you wondering what will happen next, even when you know the historical ending.A very enjoyable book to read!
__label__1 Tawdry: For a classier historical novel about the Boleyns, I recommend The Lady in the Tower by Jean Plaidy.
__label__2 Scandle, sex, and fun: I never really was all that interested in the whole Henry VIII thing but I was given this book and just started reading the first couple of pages. It really has a way of engaging you from the start. In the beginning Mary is only a little girl involved in this larger than life role she has to play. You follow her along with her exciting life, and just when things start to cool off for her, you become fixed on her sister. I loved reading how nasty the author made her. I know there are legends of how Ann really was a royal pain. The author did a good job playing it up. It really is quite long over 650 pages, but you wouldn't know it, I read it in 6 days. Its really a page turner. It really only portrays Ann, and Mary in depth, and I liked that. I also liked how the author depicts an aging, baby of a king who likes to get his own way. In the end the author does an amazing job wrapping up the looses ends to the already known facts making this history/fiction story a great read.
__label__1 Not worth the time: First let me say that the purchasing end of this exchange was excellent. The book reached me promptly and was in fine condition physically. If only the writing were at least half as fine. The conversations sounded 20th century, not remotely 16th century. Nor did they sound like genuine exchanges among the Boleyn siblings but instead like devices to let the reader know explicitly what was going on in the palaces and historically. The author's choice of starting with a wholly naive narrator (Mary in her early teens) and increasing her knowledge and perceptiveness was not unwise in itself, but was clulmsy in execution. She seems altogether too dense for too long, and even after she's much more worldly still frequently demonstrates her "cotton head". There's no denying that the Tudor era was racy and dangerous. If this is the only book at hand on that subject, grab it and skim.
__label__2 Makes you want to keep reading on: A wonderfully written book that gives insight into a siginificant time in history with a very personnel look.
__label__2 Easy reading: Book is very different than the movie, it's more indept. I enjoyed it, would recommend to fans of the Tudor age.
__label__2 LOVED THIS BOOK: I loved this book. I seen the movie and have to say the book is so much better. I finished reading it then started reading it all over again. This was the first book I've read about Henry VIII and its inspired me to want to know everything I can about that time. Now I own over 30 books about Tudor history. I want to read everything I can get my hands on, and I never bore of it. And to think I owe it all to this book! It's from Mary Boleyn's point of view. You will see her challanges as well as Anne and the rest of their family. You will feel like your right there at court with them. It's an exciting and fearful time at the court of Henry VIII. It is also very accurate and I highly recommend it. Its one of Phillippa Greggory's better books. I've read all her books and this one is by far her best work. You will fall in love with the Tudor era if your not already.
__label__2 History Brought to Life: This book, first and foremost, brings to life the pure beauty of Britain; the old houses, wildlife and its rather bizarre history and has made me very proud of where I come from.The Other Boleyn Girl is extremely readable and tells of the rise and fall of the Boleyn family. I have never been much of a person for history but this book certainly interested me and went beyond anything I could have learnt in history class.I recommend this book without really saying why (for fear of ruining parts) but coming from a history know nothing I say it is definitely worth a read if you want to know about the greed of one man and the unstoppable ambition of one tragic family.
__label__1 I Already Knew the story: I have to admit, I usually do not like historical fiction...this book was no exception. I read half, and read the end because it was boring.....
__label__1 Historical Fiction Overdone!: With an emphasis on the "fiction" part! This could've been a really good novel but it fell way short. I guess I just prefer historical fiction to be well, historical!
__label__1 Finally finished it: I liked how it started, with the beheading of a relative. And details of court life were interesting, at the beginning, but became tedious with the repetitiveness. This book really could have been half or one-third the size, it drug on and on and on. Getting to the end was a relief, I doubt I'll read another book by this author.
__label__1 A novel for the intellectually challenged: Anyone who treasures good historical fiction will, after reading--or trying to read--THE OTHER BOLEYN GIRL--see at once that they stumbled upon what we once called a "dime novel"-that pejorative characterizing hack writing, which in our time is seen most often in historical romances-novels peopled with superficial modern characters costumed in period dress. THE OTHER BOLEYN GIRL is such a novel. In our time of computers, the internet and blogs, the dime novel has been given new life through heavy promotion and phony critiques. It's a world where lies flourish, and publications such as "Publishers Weekly" with their fatuous critiques, become co-conspirators in this deception.
__label__1 "Other Boleyn Girl" a future Lifetime movie for certain: The hallmarks are all there--the air of virtue and innocence, the first love quickly disillusioned, jealousy, backbiting, a second romance that proves to be the reason for living--yes, we will someday see some actress playing Mary Boleyn on the Lifetime channel in "The Other Boleyn Girl." That's all this novel is fit for. Mary Boleyn is the most bovine "heroine" I've ever encountered, and Philippa Gregory's writing never gets above the Weepie of the Week level. The Boleyns are a fascinating subject for fiction; they aren't served well or made interesting by Gregory's book...
__label__2 One of the best books I have ever read!: This book is a wonderfully and thrillingly written account of the machinations of the Boleyn-family to get close to the throne at the times of Henry VIII. Mary Boleyn is ordered by her family to be at King Henry's command whatever his wishes and whims. She obeys her family, since she is barely 13 when first presented to the king. She succeeds in keeping him at her side for a while, until his eyes begin to wander again and he seeks fulfilment (in every way) elsewhere. All of a sudden she is commanded to stand back and let her sister Anne bathe in the king's glory. In my opionion Mary was quite helpless, whereas her sister Anne is portrayed as a scheming whore. The author has a fabulous way with words and if you are interested in English history written at a wonderful pace as well as a thrilling account(in other words: you will probably be utterly, competely, totally unable to put this book down, once you have started) this is a book you simply cannot miss!
__label__2 Very enjoyable...: Just finished and I could go back and read it again. Ms. Gregory truly 'gets' the era, history and nuances of court life and brings to life how it affects each character.
__label__2 A "can't put down" book!: It's one of the greatest books I've ever read. It's beautifully written. Gregory finds a great balance of description, not to much not to little. She has this great ability to make the reader feel as he were in that space and time. I also found that the author leaves you with the feeling of "wanting to find out more" which I find great. I finished this book last night (2am, couldn't stop reading)and first thing in the morning I was at the bookstore looking for more books on the topic. I'm going to start "The secret diary of Anne Boleyn" , I hope it's as good as this one. Don't miss this great read!!!
__label__2 A Fast Read: I breezed through this book and I found it a great read. I had a hard time with some of the stuff, like being married at twelve and the beheading, however, I enjoyed the view point from so long ago and how very difficult women had it. I have leant this book out and haven't gotten it back!
__label__2 When Movies were More Fun: I had recorded this movie originally off of TV years ago. It is in my opinion one of the classics and it brought back plenty of memories. What I really appreciated with this DVD is that it included the viewer to watch the film at it was originally intented. It's definitely worth the price of admission.
__label__2 13 Ghosts Review: I saw the newer version a couple years ago and never knew that it was a remake. Then I found out that Martin Milner was in it and I knew I had to see it. This was your typical old black and white movie. With the typical dialogue that you would think. But I thought this movie was really funny, i know it's not supposed to be but oh well. Different times during the movie the background would change to blue and then ghosts would appear in red. The problem that I didnt realize when I bought this movie was that you need those 3-D glasses to view the ghosts without straining your eyes. I really liked this movie. It wasnt as scary as the recent one but it was a good horror movie for the 60's.
__label__1 Disappointed....: I've bought two copies of this movie on DVD and each one was missing the ghost viewers. Buyer beware if you buy this DVD....you may get what you pay for or you may not.
__label__1 good idea, poor implementation: Poor quality product. Great idea - my daughter was super-excited to get this one, but flash light broke right away, binoculars are not strong at all, thermometer on the whistle does not reflect outside temp-re properly. Very disappointing purchase.
__label__2 A very pretty decoration for all, and fun for children: The lovely watercolor print shows a pond skating scene, full of Holly Pond Hill bunnies in their victorian costumes. Very sweet! There is a little flap to open for each day of the advent season with a cute little surprise inside.It will stand upright on a table or under your tree. It can be stored for use in years to come.I'm looking forward to starting an advent calendar tradition with my toddler this year. She'll really enjoy those cute bunnies.
__label__2 Flawless: Worked perfectly from the start. Simple. Clean. No hassle. Pay close attention to instructions regarding using pump to stimulate ink flow, and avoid refilling a cartridge which has been empty for some time (it has dried up and may not refill properly). Also, as another reviewer mentioned, the calibration marks on the ink tank serve as an excellent guide to monitor how much ink has gone into the cartridge.Construction quality is very precise... much better than I would have expected for a product of this nature. This product will save HUGE dollars over feeding HP their profit gouging prices for OEM. Hooray!
__label__2 Clear and concise, but requires supplementation: Griffiths' QM text provides excellent problems and a coherent, though somewhat cryptic, development of the theory. He has a conversational style (also evident in his EM text) that elucidates many of the hard-to-visualize concepts in QM. However, he relies on the use of many specialized techniques to solve problems. If the student is unfamiliar with the mathematical tricks involved, it leads to frustration. I recommend Griffiths' text as the main book in a QM course only if it is supplemented with additional hints (from the professor) on the problems, or with an additional text such as Shankar's or the Eisberg and Resnick work.
__label__2 Not just for breast feeding moms :-): Three words...BUY A BOPPY! Its not just for breastfeeding moms, though I can definately see how it would be a great asset for those who choose to breastfeed.I've used it during feedings, to take some strain off my arm (because baby can get heavy to hold in an upright position that is best for bottle feeding.) I've also used it to prop my baby up in a sitting position and she loves it! She looks so comfortable, I almost wish they made adult size boppys :-) I have also put it around my waist (and yes, it does bring back prego memories!) and layed the baby in it so she can snuggle close to me while my hands are free to do other things (read, change the channel, etc.) A great buy for every parent!
__label__2 PHOTOGRAPHERS HELPER: I don't have children yet, but my profession is a photographer, and with infants so little it's sometimes hard to get them in a perfect pose, the boppy is a great tool to get a natural look, you can cover it with a blanket to match whatever you want, so next time you go to get those special memories captured, bring along your boppy and introduce your favorite photographer to the boppy, ( i also prop it up a little if they are on a table, and the camera is fixed ie jcpenney or sears) Congrats to all and many smiles!!!
__label__2 AWESOME PRODUCT: I LOVE THIS! I AM A FIRST TIME MOM WHO BREAST FEEDS MY BABY AND I FOUND THIS TO BE SUCH A LIFE SAVER! MY SON IS 9 MONTHS NOW AND WE STILL USE IT ALMOST EVERY FEEDING. IT SAVES YOUR ARM AND NECK FROM FEELING STRAINED AND HOLDS THE BABY AT JUST THE RIGHT LEVEL FOR NURSING. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANY MOTHER.
__label__1 Don't really get it...not useful for us at all!: I breastfed my daughter until she was a year old and found the Boppy to be pretty much useless. It wasn't the right height for nursing for me and I preferred to use a smaller pillow which conformed to my daughter's body better.We used it once or twice for sitting up, but most of the time, she was supported by my legs or multiple pillows. I think this is one of those products that's either love/hate--for us, it has to be the latter!
__label__1 recalled boppy: I went to target today to purchase this boppy. Apparently it has been recalled and they took all the other ones off the shelf. I don't know why it has been recalled yet but I wanted to warn the amazon buyers first.
__label__1 Wait to buy: I urge mothers to wait to purchase the boppy. I was sold by all the rave reviews, bought the pillow and never used it. I had an 8 lbs. 9 oz. baby boy and found it difficult to nurse him with it. It got in the way. Now it just sits in a corner. I guess I'll use it when he's learning to sit up to prop him up with. I urge mothers to borrow one first to see if they like it before spending the $.
__label__2 A great product!: We got this to support our arms while bottle feeding (though it seems to be known for breastfeeding-it is helpful to us bottle feeders as well.) The unique shape is great because it can be turned to be comfortable for different sized people and different height chairs. Also, our 2 week old loves to lie in it. It keeps him snuggled and supported and it gives our arms a break now and then! :) The pillow is so soft that sometimes when I snuggle with him in it that both of us take a little nap! It is a bit pricy (that's why it's 4 stars and not 5), but it makes a great gift!
__label__2 Great for taking pretty photos: This Boppy was very helpful in feeding my daughter during the early weeks of life. It also helped with laying her down when she was in the phase of waking up everytime you put her down. I would nurse her and then transfer her to the bed on the pillow, then remove the pillow. But most of all, I loved taking photos of my daughter with the clouds as the backround. It makes some of the most beautiful pictures when they are small and can't do much.
__label__2 Roses are reds, violets are blue, this movie is recommended for you!: A warm and rather lighthearted movie that is pleasing to most tastes and obviously uplifting to the vast majority of reviewers here at Amazon. Not a whole lot of character development throughout the movie, but the characters are rather endearing nonetheless. Some will be skeptical as to the plausibility of such a prison set up, but it was refreshing to see an approach to incarceration that offers some real rehabilitation and redemption.
__label__2 This was so funny: I saw this movie at a preview screening in L.A. and I thought it was amazing.... it was such a cute, original story and all the actors were great. Clive Owen (who was in Croupier last year) was especially good - he is going to be a big star. This is a movie for everyone who loved Saving Grace and Waking Ned Devine.
__label__1 Definitely a disappointment!: I had a hard time finishing this book. Not enough adventure for me. I was actually glad when I finally reached the end. I kept thinking the storyline might improve but to no avail. Definitely a disappointment.
__label__1 SORDID BOOK!: While Golding is correct in that there is a dark side to human nature, he is a fool for having created such an implausible plot.Boys of that age rarely attack people under any circumstances.Instaed, they use more subtle forms of psychological warfare.They could only have acted like that if they had had to eat each other to survive. To expect boys to shrug off social conditioning in such a short time is, however absurd.
__label__1 how can you like this?: this book had good morals but it was so confusing, that to even understand one of the main points in the book i needed cliffs notes. some of it was exciting inside the chapter but i cant remember one cliffhanger chapter ending. trust me, if you are a teen, take it from another, unless FORCED to read this for school (like i was) dont read this book. it isnt worth your effort to read such a terrible book. whoever called it a classic is crazy
__label__2 Golding at his Greatest: Golding certainly seems to root out the very psychology that lays behind the rudimentary world of the male youth. In magnificently eloquent prose and a deeply engrossing story to boot, Lord of the Flies has deservedly been dubbed a modern classic. One can relate to the actions of the characters simply because we were all once of that age and were all once driven by the same urges, impulses, and emotions that Golding so graphically and yet so effectively illustrates. An essential read there can be no doubt......
__label__2 Authority: I believe that the author's purpose in the "The Lord of the Flies" was to show that without laws, there would be chaos in the world. To show that authority is trully needed in the world . I agree one hundred percent with this message because there is a need for consequences for people who refuse to listen to authority. The literary element that Golding handled the best was symbolism. For example, the conch was a symbol of authority and power. When the conch was broken , there was no authority , but complete chaos. This book is believeable because it is possible to get stranded on an island and it is possible for people to become mean and spiteful. The only bad thing about the book was some of the words were hard to understand. If I had written the book. I wouldn't have used such large discriptive words But " The Lord of the Flies" was a good book and I would recommend it to my friends or anyone looking for a good book to read.
__label__2 all in all a good book: Well written but definately not my "cup of tea". High reccomendations for those who enjoy this type of literature.
__label__2 A must read: The noval "Lord of the flies" written by William Golding is one of the most complex books i have ever read. I love how this book makes you think and relate situations and characters to those in your own life. at first glance this noval may seem like its not worth reading but dont judge a book by its cover.the only reason i gave this book a 4 instead of 5 is that it diddnt seem very realistic for example: the boys age i didnt think they were old enogh to even really comprehend what they had done,also there seemed to be no remorse for death.But that is easily forgotton because of the intensity of this great book . Not only is this book entertaining and colorful but its also got a not so easily seen message.But through symbolism and getting to know the characters you will find that this book makes you see your society and yourself in a whole new way.
__label__1 Weird: I had to read this book for literiture class I hated it. my teacher rattled on about the symbolizm in this book.It was so boring and kinda gory.Plus no girls, wasnt they susposed to repopulate the world after nuclear war so not possible wih only boys. The one thing i found interesting was how they acted like wild animals after they had been on the island a while.that was kinda cool.But it was to confusing
__label__1 Not the Best novel: Well I have read this in 7th grade. I really don't think of it as a great novel. I have read better. It depends on what your taste in novels are I suppose. I know that this isn't a good review on this novel and I am sorry if this misleads you. Well, I suggest to read it before you decide whether or not you like it.
__label__2 You sure you want to read this?: This book is not for a rainy day. Rainy day's are depressing and exploring the dark side of the human soul is no less. If you are into dreams leave this book on the shelf. If you want to feel like puking from the pit of stomach at the depts of human depravity this is the book for you.One sentence to describe this book:A daring expose of the cruelty of children and a slap on the wrist of anybody who thinks kids don't need discipline.
__label__1 Most Disappointed: Well, how can I review this product when it still haven't arrived. It has apparently been resent but once again hasn't arrived. Very disappointed!!!!
__label__1 An unbelievable waste of time.: As a response to one of the reviews that speaks quite highly of this novel, I would like to say that despite my understanding and comprehension of the book, I still found it entirely dull, boring, and a waste of my time. Since it was required of me to read this book in school, I was forced to make my way through each dragging chapter, but I would have never on my own time, and it's not because I didn't understand the book that I feel this way about it. My class discussed quite thouroughly about the book's symbolism, which was Golding's intention to start out with. Despite its hidden meanings, the novel still remains absolutely ridiculous in the sense that these young British boys turn completely salvage and kill their fellow islanders. If the book was looked at through a totally symbolic perspective, it would make more sense, but in order to understand its symbolism, one still has to read it, and it is really not worth it.
__label__1 Thumbs down: God this was terrible.A group of children are marooned on a deserted island and must survive on their own. We see the rise and fall of their society as order is achieved; power corrupts the strongest of the group and the weakest members are dismissed or destroyed and finally chaos rules.Despite my dislike of this book, I'll admit it is a very true commentary on society. The powerful abuse those weaker than them; how quickly rules become obsolete when they become inconvenient; the set roles of people in society (the chubby guy with glasses can never be as powerful as the cool, good-looking guy).If you are not being forced to read this for school, please don't do it! The Simpsons parody of it is also a good thing to watch. At least in a cartoon it is entertaining, with just as much commentary on society as the original.
__label__1 It's a good book, but not my favorite: Golding was trying to say that there is evil in everyone. I do agree on this theme becuase I don't think everyone is "good". I believe everyone does something that is evil. Although, some people have it in them more than others. I think the author used a lot of description which made it really boring. He also used too much violence, which in my opinion, only made it worse. I think this can happen to anyone who is in a plane crash. Being in this situatuion can get your mind crazy and make you do weird things, like the boys did. If it was me who wrote the book, I would use less description becuase is made it boring. I would also make it less vioent.
__label__2 The Lord of the Flies is a great book.: The lLord of the Flies is a great book. It is a book that should be used in every school, because is shows a great struggle for survival on a deserted island with basicly nothing.
__label__1 Great book, but the author's reading is terrible: I love this book, but I wasn't halfway through the introduction when I realized how painful it would be to have the author read it to me. He sighs and breathes heavy in the middle of sentences, speaks in a monotone voice, and makes all the characters sound the same, which makes it hard to tell who is saying what during the book's argument scenes.Overall, great story that deserved a professional voice actor to read it - somebody who could have made the story come alive. Any nuance the author could have added through his own insight into the story was lost in the lackluster presentation.
__label__1 It is worse than reading the dictionary: It was so boring i had to induce ain to stay awake while reading i
__label__1 Yow! Lots of people wrote stuff, huh?: This book stunk. I believe that reality can have deeper meanings, but don't get to deep or you'll drown. The only time you can go that deep and not drown, is with drugs. I never thought Lord of the Flies would attract so many druggies.
__label__1 Disgusted: I was disgusted by the grotesque display of savagery in this novel. I found it lacking purpose and realism. All I found in this novel is one man's sick views of humanity. I do not reccomend this novel to anyone, especially children.
__label__2 Innate Savagery: Even though it's been years since I first encountered this novel, I still vividly recall the brave leadership of Ralph, the understanding innocence of Piggy, the thrill of the hunt, the smell of the pigs blood, and the intense primitive nature that takes dominion over the boys. The exploration of the various social interactions and the influence human nature has on them is intriguing and well delineated. However, the internal savagery that slowly and universally reveals itself amongst the characters proves to be the trues force which holds this novel high in my regard. Truly captivating and dangerously luring!
__label__1 Boring: I would not reccomend this book. It was very boring and I didn't find much of a purpose. The end was the best part, but it was still bad. l did not get into this book or enjoy it. it was for school.
__label__1 I don't like the book: I am a fan of classic literature but this book was just too slow for me. Everyone should read it because it's a classic but I didn't enjoy it.
__label__2 A brilliant achievement. Symbolism beyond comparison.: This is my favorite book yet (and by the way, I've read quite a few.) Not only is the symbolism masterful, but the book is thoroughly interesting and captivating as well. I am shocked at some of the criticisms of this work of such epic proportions. I honestly can't figure how anyone could find fault with it. I understand that it's not the most enjoyable of experiences to "read books for school," but this one is not one of the "boring" kind. The book is beautifully written and Golding's use of metaphor, allegory, and personification is consummate. Golding pulls all he can into this book, details from all walks of life. The book is incredible, as there is a vibrantly suspenseful surface story with ingenious characters and plot, as well as richly deep undertones of life and the depths of human heart and consciousness. All you have to do is read it.
__label__2 great classic book: this book came on time and was in good condition. It has been on my list of books to read for a very long time
__label__2 A fairly simple story with deep meaning: LOTF is a short and simple novel with a deep subject matter. Golding tries to convey his beliefs in the innate evil in individual humanity through a story wrought with simplicity.Golding does a great job in developing the characters of LOTF. The characters (unlike the 90's movie) are quite believable. Each of the main characters have their own personality and are utilized by Golding to symbolize his ideas.Golding uses a lot of imagery and symbolism, but he does this in a manner that is easy to understand. His writing style is simple and clear and without all of the complex language that can bog down a good novel. This story flows at a nice pace and never seems to "drag on".I enjoyed this novel. Underneath the symbolism there was a fast-moving, suspenseful story. And Golding did a good job in making the reader of this novel contemplate the nature of man and society. It's well worth the read.
__label__1 No wonder they call it the Lord of the Flies this book stunk: My favorite chapter in this book would definitely be the first chapter when the kids are introduced on the island. There was this one kid that everyone had called piggy. To me that is the funniest thing in the world. I don't know why but the humiliation of another kid is extremely hilarious. It may seem cruel but to me it's funny. I would have to say that this book was definitely for the older more mature kids, like high school kids. All in all I would have to say that even with the kid getting humiliated I dislike this book with a passion it is way to boring and just when you think it's going to get good the book disappoints you and I don't think that is a very good book for the serious reader
__label__1 a conventional view of mankind: this book exists to support the author's opinion that man is brutish and destructive.this was written well before clinical studies of violance, child abuse, the effects of peer pressure, etc. it reflects the basic christain view that man is vile.itis obvious that golding never considers that by the time any of these boys has spent time in their families and then in the prep school, any natural impulse has been thoroughly ground out bysocial standards. these boys are as affected by all they psychological influences as adults, with fewer methods to deal with them.of course they revert to so-called savagery--it's what they experienced at their school. of course there are no intelligent responses, we aren't trained to use intelligent response.the book is a polemic of the conservative christian--man is vile and must be controlled or he will become a savage.nurture has no place.i find it a completely annoying book, presenting an unrealistic result.
__label__1 Took too long: It's great ordering a book, and the book was good, but the delivery took so long that I had to go to the bookstore and get it for my daughters class anyway, so it was really a waste. Shouldn't take over two weeks to get a book.
__label__1 May be a classic...but not as good as people think: I was required to read this book for school in my Honors English Class(9th grade), I found it very hard to follow and too symbolic. This is the book of dreams for any English teacher who loves to get their students to read between the lines. Personally, I enjoy a book that is a challenging read, but in this book, every little detail meant something "deeper" and it gave me a headache trying to interpret the aspect of society the detail was trying to depict. I understood the book, but, it was not enjoyable for me and if it were not a required reading, I would not have read the book otherwise. But, if you like books to give you a headache, then this is perfect for you.
__label__1 Lord of the Flies was creative, but lost our attention.: We think that the book, Lord of the Flies, was just 'ok'. It was an intense way of looking at a goodlife. We believe that the message of the novel was always have hope. We thought it could have ended better, but it pulled it all together well. Although we were bored at times, we liked the way Golding had items symbolize ideas. The book was different then ones we have read in the past, therefore, it broadened our views of good versus evil.
__label__2 A great book on so many levels: I first read this book at a young age. I enjoyed it very greatly then. Not as an allagory for anything or as anything of that sort but as a story of adventure and survival. Recently I have read it with my english class and explored the symbolism and allegories. I think that the lord of the flies is a very strong book with a strong message that can be understood at many levels and I think that this is a book that ever family that enjoys reading should own. The Lord of the Flies can be enjoyed and reread by people of all ages and spending an hour to read up on the symbolism in this book is well worth it as it enriches the story alot and provides a whole new meaning to the book. 5/5 for a great read for all ages.
__label__2 Shocking: I loved this book. It explores social interactions between young males, and the limits of the conscience. The ending was shocking... be prepared for an exciting story! (This is middle school reading)
__label__1 Novel review of the Lord of the Flies: The Lord of the Flies by William Golding wasn't as good as I thought it was going to be. I thought that the idea of the book was very good and the theme was well thought out, but i don't think it was well written. Some parts could have been better, but it was interesting. Somethings I disliked were that there were only boys on the island and no girls. If there were girls I think the story would have been different. I also didn't like how Piggy died. I think the book would have had a better ending if Piggy stayed alive.Some things that i liked about the book were most of it was realistic. The schoolboys made rules for themselves, and there became two sides. I liked how the characters were described and how the meanings of their names mathed their actual names.
__label__2 Nice Book: I think it was a good book because the story was very interesting and easy to read . The message of the novel is very important important because it relates to ancient times, morden times and the future you must read this book.
__label__2 Adventouros story, good plot and fantastic characters!: This is a book for every teen to read. It gives the feelng of pride... and intense excitment!
__label__2 Thought-provoking, creepy, depressing, and intuitive: I read this book two years ago for a grade 10 English class, and have not had the chance to reread it, but I do remember it well. The premise is not especially exciting initially, but it becomes a living parable of terror.I find it interesting that the author used boys as his subjects rather than little girls, or both. But would this have changed the outcome? That is something you must decide for yourself. Also, when finally "saved", the naval officer is confused as to what the boys are doing exactly, and yet Ralph knows exactly. Perhaps children are not as intellectually inferior as we are assumed to be.Though chilling, I highly recommend this book, as it gives a startling clear view of broken society. It's pessimistic, but perhaps, all too realistic.
__label__2 Everyone Should Read this Novel: This is one of those novels that everyone should read. Through isolation on a remotes island, we get to glimpse the life of these young boys and how chaos takes over their uncivilized new world. The refelection on human nature may be frightening but it is riveting and honest.Lord of the Flies is a short and easy read, and it should not be missed. I highly recommend this novel!
__label__2 the what ol' days?: I cannot say enough about this book. There is so much depth in it and so much ot think about. There's more than just an innocence lost thing in it -like the choir leader, Jack, becoming the most evil on the island. I think Golding meant to imply that innocence is an illusion, as shallow as the choir boys' outfits. Being a substitute teacher for both high school and middle school, I would vouch Golding's implications hold true even for kids who aren't lost on desserted islands. Ultimately, the island signifies a pre-adolescent's experience, as being cut off from the world while admist a wild sway of new emotions. I'm glad this book exists, because peopel need access to eloquent articulation of youth's experiences.
__label__1 A girlie book with lots of blood: Friends who know I`m interested in war history recommended this book. But this is not war history. This is a rather banal love story mixed up with a lot of bloody details. If you are looking for the real stuff, go somewhere else.
__label__1 Disappointing: Outdated and Not Useful: This book was written in 1987! Technically speaking, it's completely out of date.My major criticism, though, is the low value of the content. Do we really need to be taught that soft or pastel colors appeal more to women? Not only is that kind of thinking outdated, but who needs to read a book with that level of "information"?
__label__1 They cut the extras: I dunno about the stand-alone Blu Ray, but the DVD of "Otis" has a ton of great extras (commentary, deleted/alternate scenes/ending, featurette, trailers, etc.). This version, however, has no extras whatsoever. I thought the point of Blu Ray was being able to jam more on the disc while maintaining superior picture quality.On the plus side, "Dr. Giggles" has never looked better, and this seems to be the only Blu Ray release of that film. Though it's weird that they've paired it with a completely unrelated movie made nearly 20 years later.If you're only interested in the films themselves, you can't beat the price. But the lack of extras is irksome.
__label__1 Extremely poor continuation: I am a big Jane Austen's fan, and I love to read the continuations and sequels. However, I had trouble finishing this book. The break in the writing between Austen's original text and the addition is glaring. The style changes, the characters change, the plot leaps wildly. It's almost like two books -- the author shouldn't have bothered keeping the original text. She probably would have done better rewritting it to fit her own style. I highly recommend reading the other Sanditon continuation by Anne Telscombe instead. It does a seamless job of continuing and the characters stay in character.
__label__1 very dull and witless: This was a dull read that I had to force myself to finish. The plot wanders aimlessly and is hard to follow. Mnay of the other continuations are better than this so I would recommend saving your money.
__label__1 Not for kids under 12 years old: While the finished product--a working phone with see-through cover and flashing lights--is great, this toy is definitely not easy to assemble. It took a bright 9-year-old, her 40-year-old aunt, and the child's grandfather (well-versed in electronics) two hours or more to finally get all the pieces in place! The parts seem to be well made and the phone really *does* work, but the directions are very difficult to understand and there was no explanation whatsoever of how a phone works. In short, what was supposed to be a fun "learning experience" turned out to be an exercise in frustration. This kit is probably best suited for teenagers or adults who already have some background in electronics.
__label__2 Compact Phono: Portable And Plays 78 RPMs: This battery operated little jewel allows playing of old 78's and stillsounds reasonable in it's single onboard speaker mode. It also has thestandard stereo outputs to drive an external soound system for all threeRPMs. All this and it's built to pack around.My wife called it one of the best electronics purchases I've ever made..
__label__2 A great, varied album.: Techno, house, ambient, dance, electronica, whatever you want to call it, "Everything is Wrong" is just great music by a great artist. It has everything a fan of pop music could want.
__label__2 THE favorite book in our house.: We love reading this book to our six month old. It has a rhythm to it that makes it so much fun. The illustrations are adorable and the story-line is very creative. The cardboard books are best for a young baby who likes to turn the pages too.I give this book as gifts all the time.
__label__1 Very concerned about The Einstein Syndrome: First of all, I am quite offended by this author. I am a licensed speech-language pathologist with 30 years of experience in the public school system. I am currently working as a special education coordinator in (heaven forbid) a public school system. I read about children and their issues/concerns/characteristics continuously. This book was recommended by a parent and I was very excited to read it. I was not prepared for the assault on speech-language pathologists and others in the public schools of America. I truly wish the author would do a more thorough investigation of our credentials and our job performances. We are not in the business of "creating business". Believe me, we have plenty to keep us busy. We are, however, very dedicated to children and their needs....whether that involves "Einstein type children", Asperger's, Autistic, Hyperlexic, Attention Deficit Disordered, Gifted or any of the multitude of diagnoses.
__label__2 Einstein Syndrome...Bright Children Who Talk Late: If you have a child that is late with speech development, seems frustrated with communications, strong willed & defiant, prone to tantrums, good at solving puzzles, loving but sometimes aloof, concentrates on some tasks, ignores requests to perform other tasks, not the least interested in potty training, exhibiting some autistic or PDD tendancies but having exceptional memory and suprising intelligence, then you need to get this book. Don't be put off by reviews of the professionals, the book has some information that will help concerned parents bypass those professional egos and cut to the main issue, how to best understand and help your child.
__label__2 How to go to College Almost for Free: I bought this for my grandson, he has already written in for several grants, and working on more. This is a great gift for any high school kid, and even kids in college. I don't believe the parents should go into debet for this, the kids will do much better if they have to work for it. I've seen to many parents almost go broke with several kids at college at the same time. They end up with nothing for retirement. Believe me, you need a nest egg.Take if from a grandma that has a great pension.
__label__2 Cool Book: I'm not much for writing book reviews, but this book was so good that I decided to do so anyway. The author has really done a comprehensive treatment of the subject of college scholarships. This is the scholarship book to get.
__label__2 How To Go To College For Almost Free: This book is very informative. Ben Kaplan manages to convey the information in a fun and lighthearted manner. This is a great book for parents and students alike.
__label__1 The academic types love it.: I guess it makes one feel intellectually in touch if he can praise this book. I guess I will never make it to that level, because I think this is one terrible book. I read approximately 100 pages on the traits of Fox Edwards, therefore, I was a little upset when I found out it was for no reason. I read with interest the last few pages where I found out that Wolfe's editor had to piece together several parts of this book, and then he had to write many pages in order to tie this mess together. All of this occured after Wolfe's death. I believe this is a collection of ramblings from Thomas Wolfe. I am sure that I can be attacked verbally for not understanding the meaning of this great work, but if it was truly a great work, I would not have missed its significance. Please, play with the kids, walk around the block, start drinking, but don't waste your time on this book.
__label__2 THE great American literary genius of the 20th Century.: Let's see now ... have you bought in to the "PowerPoint," bullet-ed, "concise" notion of literature (i.e., stupid, undeveloped, soul-less notion of expressing what it is to be human?) --In THAT case, you will find the works of Thomas Wolfe (as you find the works of Marcel Proust or Thomas Mann) a great big bore. Otherwise ... you will NOT find them a bore; but the very opposite of a bore:--a source of inspiration, of joy, of excitement, of the quintessence of life.
__label__2 Orson Welles and Magic: I have always been a fan of Orson Welles on radio and television. Having collected a ton of radio broadcasts on CD and audio cassette and having watched most of his movies, I appreciate the genius of his work. I picked up a copy of this book recently and am amazed at the amount of research put into it. An aspect of Welles rarely discussed is his magic career. At the Mid-Atlantic Nostalgia Convention this September in Aberdeen, Maryland, I plan to attend the presentation about Orson Welles and his magic career so I can watch rare footage and films with Welles, and get an even deeper insight to his trickery. Book comes recommended.
__label__2 Used It For Years: We've used this product for many years. It cleans stainless steel coffee pots perfectly. They shine better than they did when new.
__label__1 Poor Service from Home and Beyond: I still have not receivied what I ordered and paid for. They claim the first shippemnt was damaged and have yet to ship a replacement. Three phone calls were not returned from them. The vendor is very slow to resolve the problem. They said it would be here last week, now it is this week. I have no confidence that they will ever deliver the product.
__label__1 Vapid and vacuous: The main character was insufferable. Parker has tried to create a male Spencer but fails miserably. She appears to be without fault and has an answer for everything. At least Spencer admits to feet of clay. The plot was implausible.
__label__1 Dumber & Dumber: Yeah, same wisecracking dialogue, sidekicks, and relationship quandaries as the Spenser novels.Realized the plot was familiar a few chapters in-- lifted from previous early Spencer novel.Characterizations inconsistent and contrived if not absurd-- a lot of villainous stereotypes-- and the plot point that the whole story is based on is ludicrous.There are much better written "guilty pleasures" than this one-- some by the same author.
__label__2 Parker's new charge...: Being a huge Spenser fan I am of course a Robert B. Parker fan. Sunny Randall makes her debut in this yarn of sex, deceit and extortion. Not his best but getting his feet wet with this new female perspective, he makes more than a solid effort. (he gets the ball rolling in following tales) I'm grateful to Mr. Parker and his pen (figuratively???) If you are a fan...don't miss it. If you're not...WHY not???!!!!
__label__2 Hard rock meets ambient: Listening to the song 'Alone' right now compels me to write this review. If nothing, buy this CD only for this track. A 10-minute long epic ambient composition. Showcases the genius that Moby is. There are several other very good songs on this album. This album is predominantly hard/punk rock with some softer ambient pieces sparsed in between. Most people know Moby for his work on techno and ambient music, but here Moby shows his versatility by doing an equally good job with hard rock. Many of the songs have him screaming at the top of his voice, but rest assured, they are still good and not average hard/punk rock music. Again, Moby shows that he doesn't go by what sells. Rather he goes by his artistic instinct and likes to experiment with different genres of music.Most of Moby's works are highly underrated and misunderstood. This is one of them. Moby's music is intelligent music. Unfortunately, not many people can understand or appreciate that.
__label__2 Awesome series.: The autumn series its just amazing,I first bought them in ebooks but it was so good thAt I had to buy the complete series in paperback.It's amazing how after so many books the author keeps you in suspense and doesn't get boring,this Moody guy it's really gifted.
__label__1 GSM Phones: Alot of stuff for Nokia is GSM only. Pull off your battery, and take a look at your Nokia phone. The older phones that alot of people carry is TDMA/CDMA, like the 5185. Guess what? It dosen't work.
__label__2 excellent reading: this is the best book i have ever read on jesus other than the bible. this man was very knowledgeable about his subject. he was also very familiar with his subject [jesus] as you will see when you read this book. no christian should be without this book in his library.
__label__2 typos galore!: I do not intend to review content here. This new edition is so full of typographical errors that sometimes the reader will have to intuit what the author really wrote. It is clear that the proofreaders of this edition were not actually reading; they were simply following the little red lines under the "misspelled" words. This has resulted in some truly bizarre apparent statements by the author, unreproducible here due to copyright laws. Disclaimer-- I have not purchased this book, merely checked it out of the library.
__label__1 Overrated: This book is overrated by a longshot. If I didn't know any better I could swear that this book wasn't even edited! Turtledove has 50 things going on at once! There are too many characters and too little continuity. I would recommend this book to anyone who has insomnia.
__label__1 Very slow: Turtledove certainly has a good grasp of history but the quality of his writing is only so-so. When you combine this with a very long plot development and stereotypical characters it is almost impossible to finish one volume, let alone all four. An editor would have been useful but perhaps the publisher figured enough people would keep paying for the whole series that no editing was needed.
__label__2 Fresh and exciting!: When I first heard the cd I was a bit shocked. These musicians really have a unique way of playing these pieces. I am quite used to period performances of romantic music but this feels really unique. The more I listen, I start to appreciate and understand the point in using the playing style that they do. I realize that this is very close to the way it ones sounded and that is very exciting I think. The lack of constant vibrato and the glissandos that are frequently used creates a completely new atmosphere which I think is very suitable for this music. I really recommend this disc and believe that the Eroica quartet has a bright future ahead of itself. And that what they do today...will shape the sound of tommorow!
__label__2 Great for the beginner, the experienced, and the wanna-be: This is one of the few dog books I own that I would gladly spend money on again.I especially appreciate their section on selecting a dog specifically for the sport. Since most of us skijor with our pets, they make a point of emphasising what you want to live with 365 days a year. They also have a great section on training for races.My only hope is that they'll have a new edition out someday including training details for distance skijoring, which is bound to be a growing segment of the sport.
__label__2 Great product!: I took a chance ordering this product, because there weren't many reviews. I'm glad I did! I got it a few days ago. Connecting my PC to my TV went fine (basicaly, my TV serves as a second PC monitor now), and after adjusting the screen resolution, the image was perfect. Very little fuzzyness. The quality of the videos I played was very good, and well transfered to the TV. The cables are not super long, something to think about if your PC and TV are far apart. A good choice, and I'll update in a few weeks/months to say how it holds up!
__label__2 A Definite Page Turner!: This was an excellent story about World War II. Three friends who share quality time at Sakkara on an archeological expedition are seperated by the War. Harry Waever is in military intelligence for the United States. His other two friends,Jack Halder and Rachel Stern are at work for the Nazis. They are setting up a German plan to assasinate Roosevelt and Churchill in Egypt. It is up to Weaver to stop them. They are of course reunited. This excellent book has many surprises as well as manytwists and turns. The book will definitely leave you wondering what if? Be sure to read this book, you will not be dissapointed.
__label__2 Enthralling: My son and I started reading parts of this in the car on a trip. We are both aficionados of anything mythological, and encountering these profound, rich, and unusual stories has been inspiring to both of us (but probably most inspiring to my son). The stories we have read so far are presented both as myths, but also as possibilities, expanding the idea of what might have been and what might be, offering also a window of insight into the times in which the myths were captured. The myths are largely framed within the context of the Christian and Roman Catholic Church and culture, and do reveal some of the bias of the times against the Jews and Judaic faith. While not politically correct, this is a solid well-written work with much education potential, if placed in context and not read as a sole work on the topic. One of the best free books I've gotten for the Kindle!
__label__1 Great book; the worst print quality you'll ever seen: The book delivered by Amazon.com looks like a photocopied book, not a printed one. Paper quality is the worst. It's totally incompatible with the US$ 140 price.It should be out-of-print or something and then Prentice-Hall found it cheaper to photocopy and bind it, rather then issuing a new edition. Amazon.com should let customers know this in advance.The book content is great as the other reviewers have said, but I'm about to see a book with worse print quality than the one Amazon sent me.I wish I have bought a used book, printed 15 years ago, for US$ 40.
__label__1 Not good: I tried to read it, it was just so boring and bad. His other books are good, this book is not.
__label__1 bad video: James Earl Jones butchers the narration of this 'live' presentation (he was far worse on the actual broadcast: this has been slightly edited!) and the actors portraying Clay Shaw and David Ferrie are horrible. This show was a classic example of the overkill that came after "JFK" came out in late 1991---everything good, bad, and ugly came out in book and tv form...this is one of the ugly moments.Vince Palamara
__label__1 Good packaging - no mushrooms :(: While this mushroom kit arrived in good packaging and looked ready to go, I was not able to get it to produce mushrooms. I followed the instructions keeping it moist and at the cooler temperatures, but nothing ever happened. I also tried oyster mushrooms a few weeks prior to that, and got huge crops of those, so I was disappointed that these didn't grow at all.
__label__2 satisfying middle book of a fantasy/romance trilogy: Valeria is now accepted by the Riding School, where gods of patterns and time take the shape of white stallions and help determine the future of the Empire. But she and her teacher, First Rider Kerrec, both carry damage from their encounters with enemies of the Empire. Those same enemies, barbarians who follow the Unmaking (which would lead to the destruction of the world), threaten the Empire again. Can two damaged Riders, and the stallion gods who carry them, help the Empire win a deadly war?While this is the middle book of a trilogy, I preferred it to both the beginning and concluding books. I tend to be a reader of fantasy rather than romance, and I actually think that the romantic triangles/quadrangles in the other two books detracted from the plots of those books. They really felt sort of forced to me.
__label__1 beware: First of all, this book isn't 344 pages as listed. It is only 156. Secondly, this book only consists of english words and their chinese equivalents in simplified character form. NO pinyin and NO example sentences. This book would only be useful to Chinese people who want to translate english words directly into Chinese. This book is advertised as both english-chinese and chinese-english, however there is no chinese-english. I ordered this book before it was released and just received it. I am extremely disappointed. I repeat: NO Pinyin and NO example sentences.
__label__1 Sometimes less is more!: I saw this film because I was such a fan of the orignal version. What a dissapointment. This film goes heavy on the gross-out and special effects because the story is weak and full of holes. The original was much scarier because of what you didn't see. The imagination is a powerful tool. We can imagine much worse that what we see. Just knowing the blob was somewhere, without actually seeing too much of it provided me with years of nightmares. I own the DVD of the original and watch it at least six or seven times a year. Matt Dillon was the flavor of the month when the remake came out. His performance was less than remarkable. An earlier review mentioned that Dillon was a much better choice of teen angst/rebellion than was Steve McQueen. Interesting, where the hell has Dillon been since this abortion of a film? McQueen is an icon and is still much more popular than Dillon. McQueen is also dead.
__label__2 The Blob- Fear has no shape: This 1988 version of The Blob is fantastic. I Love this movie so much, words cannot describe. Shawnee Smith, Kevin Dillion, Donovan Leitch, erika eleniak, candy clarke and the always georgeou Ricky Paull Goldin are all perfectly cast in their roles. The effects are great. I adore the music. Chuck Russell made the best movie. One of the best movies around.
__label__1 A family saga that disappoints: I got this book because Ursula Hegi wrote an Oprah Winfrey pick "Stone From the River" some years ago and I remember enjoying that book.. While I love a good family saga, I cared nothing about any of the characters in this book. It was tedious, boring and repetitive. The premise of how an act in childhood affects members of several families for years to come seemed intriguing, but it was the only reason that held me to the end and then I realized that the book was actually a waste of time.
__label__2 Excellent even for those without formal musical training: Excellent book. Does not assume any musical training, explains everything starting with the music notation. The exercises are truly gradual: each introduces only a few new hand positions, and future exercises reinforce hand positions introduced earlier. The early exercises are simple yet sound reasonably well not to be hopelessly boring, and one can hear when one plays them incorrectly. Great book for self-study. It was recommended to me independently by two very good classical guitar players; and my technique and sight-reading skills have improved notably since starting to use this book.
__label__2 Another rocking Weeds Season.: Yet another awesome season of Weeds. A must have it you have the other 3 seasons.
__label__2 Great series: A must have series. On the lines of Sherman Oaks if anyone actually saw it). Hats off too showtime. I only wish i could find the Sherman Oaks series on Amazon.
__label__1 Kate Mulgrew before Voyager: "A Time for Miracles" is an underrated gem. Showing a bit of American history that is often neglected, and showing Kate Mulgrew as a determined woman who was strong willed, clever, not afraid of anyone, and was fond of coffee. No wonder she was cast as Katherine Janeway.
__label__2 Endless Supply of Ink: The ink was inexpensive, considering how much ink it is. I think it will take me at least a year or two to use it all. I've been writing with the pen nonstop as my primary pen for 2 months and the first bottle isn't even noticiably lower on ink. Shipping was also fast and everthing arrived in good shape. Overall a great experience.
__label__1 How To Write a Movie in 21 Days: I purchased and read this book because it was recommended by an author that has helped me develop in the screenwriting craft. But I didn't find it particularly helpful or practical. However, you might draw some inspiration from it.
__label__2 This book makes anyone think he/she can write a screenplay with the inner movie method...: Wonderful intro...author clearly explains that if the readers want a more difficult route they can go with Syn Field's books, but this book will get you off and running & thinking about the task of screenwriting. For what the author intends to do, I give her 5stars.The Inner Movie Method is the start of your journey to writing a screenplay or to just understanding the movies you see better. It's concise, upbeat & "can do" in spirit.Accessible. Short Chapters. Exercises. Some good summaries. I like her overview of the stages of life & movie theme that concern each.A pleasure to read. Guaranteed to enhance your movie going experience.But again... this is a place to begin.
__label__2 Sarah and O'Malley: Excellent description of these two characters; Sarah is an alien, but she is also a woman who is desired and connected to O'Malley. Neither character realizes just what is happening to them at first during the landing of Sarah's spacecraft. While she is saved by O'Malley and his crew she has already defended herself on the spacecraft from some of her enemies.(Also aliens) She is very near death when it crashes in the mountains near the VLA (very large array)in New Mexico. Both Sarah and O'Malley have led very colorful lives before this encounter--and both want out of that past life. This is a book that has to be read when you have the time to just do it, cause it was hard for me to put it down.
__label__2 Out of the ashes: The Soka Gakkai was forged out of the rubble of postwar Japan. This is the story of how a small group with a generally poor and ill membership overcomes the harshness of the environment and forged a new chapter of Buddhism. For the critic above one simple question, has anyone who has criticized the SGI done anything to help humanistic causes all over the world? The only thing critics have to offer is silence.
__label__2 A Great Summary of Labor Law: I am an ESL teacher with a background in law. A Colombian lawyer who had previously studied with me asked me to help her with the differences between our labor laws. This book was an excellent introduction to labor law. Anyone who needs a summary of this area will benefit from this book.TCB
__label__1 Very disappointed!: Very disappointed with this item! First, when the knife arrived it obviously had been a return from someone else because the plastic was sliced open and the knife had been removed before. But, my son really wanted this for Christmas, so I kept it because I had not been able to find another one anywhere else. It was a Christmas present, and the leather sheath broke on Christmas Day after wearing it only about 5 hours! However, my son was very happy with the knife, so now we are trying to find another sheath for it.
__label__1 Superficial: I found the content of the book very superficial. It deals with eliminating the symptoms of lack of motivation: things like "Kill your television", "Read yourself a story"... (these are chapters titles from the book). Do not expect a deep philosophical of psychological insight about human motivation or even human nature in general from this book.
__label__2 Good video, Great Gift for new Parents: This video is an excellant video for new Moms and Dads, and in addition for anyone who will be helping with the newborn, to give Mom and Dad a break. The only drawback I found with the video was the length of the video. I wished it had gone into more detail , most specifically caring for the crying baby, and also, care of the baby up to 6 months. However, I can find no fault in this being a beginners tool for learning, and also, a refresher for us who have not taken care of an infant in many years. I purchased this video for first time parents. I wanted to watch it before giving it to make sure it would be something I would be glad to give as a present. I am glad and the parents were very happy to receive. See visually is great because reading is good but for those who are visual people, the instructions from this video will be more helpful. A great gift idea.
__label__1 Did not fit BCM carry handle: Just as the title says. This mount did not seat properly or at all on my BCM milspec carry handle. i think these are hit or miss.
__label__2 CCS Yellow Cutting Pad: Used with a Porter Cable buffer/vibrator, this yellow cutting pad along with a "cleaner" will take out buff marks and swirls. Finish off with a "white pad" and polish and then when waxed your car will look like it has a showroom finish.
__label__2 WORTH IT!!!!: Once we finally rec'd the correct item ( orig order not from this company, so no reflection on them).....my husband loves it. He uses it for cold therapy only: his preference, not that it does not work well for that. So I can only tell you for cold therapy it rocks. I did not think it was cold enough for my lower back, but it is not sculpted for that. He loves its flexibility and states it is cold enough. He uses it for chronic neck pain. Just wraps it on his neck and goes to bed: it has a Velcro strap to keep it in place. Almost like having a neck pillow on, but not as bulky. FABU product!!!
__label__1 Terrible Disappointment -- parts don't fit: My son (almost 8) and my husband (an engineer) sat down to put this together. Many of the holes were either drilled too small or, even worse, drilled in the WRONG PLACE. Some pieces are cut the wrong size and just don't fit!! What a terrible WASTE OF MONEY. There is no way to make it work without major drilling and sanding and then re-painting.My son is so disappointed -- he was really looking forward to putting this together.
__label__2 Entertaining to the last page: Trollope is addictive, but some of his books offer more nonstop entertainment than others, and this is one of those.
__label__1 Printer won't work now...: I have an HP Officejet 6210 and I figured I'd try this refill for my 94 ink cartridge. Filling it up was a pain because I had to hold the refill needly just barely into the created hole and let it drip in there slowly. My biggest problem was that after I refilled my cartridge, my printer would not let me use it anymore. I kept getting an error message that said "Please remove and check your black ink cartridge". I tried cleaning it, resetting the printer..tried everything to no avail. I contacted the manufacturer of the refill system and they rapidly sent me a new one, which I haven't tried. Now I need to buy a new ink cartridge for my printer to even operate! Very disappointed.
__label__2 good: I enjoy having a cartridge ink quick at my disposal . The cost is very economical. I will buy again.
__label__1 I was not pleased: I was having trouble finding a copy of this classic movie anywhere. I was eccited to see a copy on DVD Unfortunatley the word "COPY" is correct. It was a copy. The quality is good and the Menu looks good but the disc was definetly a copy. The case was also a copy. I am glad to have this in my collection nonetheless but was upset it was not original.
__label__1 Trite, predictable tear jerker: Given the rave reviews of others, I expected an absorbing, thought provoking read. I found instead a book riddled with cliches, superficial character development and a predictable conclusion. Having just read Ian McEwan's Atonement, the contrast was dramatic. All That Matters would be a good fit for the condensed novel section of a traditional woman's magazine. All That Matters is to fiction what Rod McEuan(Listen to the Warm) is to poetry. Why do I feel that Jan Goldstein is hoping to cash in big with this one?
__label__2 All That Matters: I thoroughly enjoyed both of Jan Goldsteins books. Both left me wanting more stories from him. Characters are alive and make you care about them almost immediately. I would recommend All That Matters to anyone and everyone.
__label__1 Item Not Available: This item was out of stock, so I did not receive it. However, I received timely notification from Amazon.com.
__label__2 Twilight Zone fans will love it: I really liked this one. It's been a long time since I've read any short story collection, and I'm glad I read this one. Actually didn't read it, I did this one on audio, there were different narrators for the stories lending different voices and all well done.Although the theme of hiring hit men was repeated in some of these stories, they all kept me guessing. Also since they were all with twist endings I anticipated what might happen but didn't often see what was coming.This is my first Jeffery Deaver book. I had avoided them since I HATED the movie of "Bone Collector" but I now want to read some more of his books; I'm hoping that Hollywood ruined a good writer's work.
__label__2 Deaver's short stories are a joy: Jeffrey Deaver is a master at creating the twist ending that you never see coming, and these stories certainly showcase his talents. I had a wonderful time reading them and every time he surprised me with the twists - sometimes several twists in each story. I particularly was caught flat-footed by "Triangle" and "The Christmas Present" (which had one of those multi-twists I mentioned). Of course, as I said, I was surprised and delighted by each of the stories and I'm sure that anyone who is familiar with Mr. Deaver's work and/or who enjoys thrillers/suspense will enjoy the stories in this book. Characters range from Shakespeare (oh, yea!) to Deaver's iconic Lincoln Rhyme as well as a host of new characters to delight and entertain readers.And, of course, once you've finished this one you can go on and get the sequel,More Twisted: Collected Stories, Vol. II. Both books heartily endorsed by yours truly!
__label__1 I want my [money] back!: I was the only one in my senior English class who loved the epic poem. Several years later I bought a copy of it at a comic book shop.For some reason, I liked Christopher Lambert, and I thought he would be a good actor for a movie based on this classic tale.Man, was I wrong!Aside from the names of the hero and one of the villians, this movie has almost nothing in common with the poem. It's got nothing in common with a good movie. It's a travesty!The acting, even with a so-called "top talent" like Christopher Lambert, is awful. The setting is almost non-existant, and the plot, ah yes, the plot ....I knew this movie would reek within the first 10 minutes. I mean, I tried really hard to be open-minded, but it was to no avail.Spare yourself the pain and skip the movie. Settle in on a dark winter's night by a fire, put on some quiet music, and read the epic poem. You'll be glad you did.
__label__1 It is a Lambert movie: Bad special effects. Lambert looked bored at times. The plot has a few holes. Too much cleavage. Bad fight scenes. Beowulf can do multiple black flips and spin in the air and yet the monsters can still hit him! The fact that Grendel's mother is pregnant doesn't really play into the movie, but they keep bringing it up. It is not the worst movie I have ever seen and I pretty much got what I expected so I'm not completely trashing it. The weapons were cool.
__label__2 Inspiring and Soul-Searching!: Through a Narrow Gate is a testament to the personal struggle between feeling the faith and wanting to somehow live it, too. I am impressed with her ability to relive the experience while being fair to both sides and making their decisions and feelings make sense, even when they are directly opposing. The most remarkable thing is her feelings about the modern convents given her struggle and her respect for what was. Her respect is contagious - she gave it to me! She, and her experiences, seem to ratify my own even as mine pale against her story. I recommend it to anyone seriously trying to understand God in their own lives and in their own terms.
__label__2 Through the Narrow Gate: Older book with new foreword. Personal discription of life in convent by well-known religious author.
__label__1 too goofy and cheesy....: Since the book is one of the more expensive Luna line books, I just wanted to throw my two cents in to hopefully save you some of YOUR hard earned money since I already wasted mine on this book.What started out as quirky and light, quickly turned terribly cheesy, goofy,implausible and over the top cliche' with an almost nonexistent storyline about 80 pages in. It reads like teen fiction-and not in a good way. And yet again in the steadily disappointing Luna line-almost zero romance. Take my advice and skip this sad attempt.
__label__1 Eggs stuck immediately: I bought this pan because Consumer Reports gave it such high marks. The very first time I used it, my egg whites stuck to it. I used a plastic spatula as recommended as well. I'll be getting my money back as it has a 60 day trial period.
__label__2 Perfect!: We received this as a wedding gift. Three years later it looks like new! It cleans easily, cooks wonderfully, and has a great weight to it. I've never had a teflon pan last so long without any signs of wear or tear. This is probably the wedding gift we have used more than all others, and I couldn't be more satisfied.
__label__2 A daughter of the Mennonites: Very good. READ until 5:00 AM and could not wait to finish the book today. Would recommend it to any age group.
__label__1 Needlessly Repetitive to Make the Story More Interesting: This is the first Hillerman story I've read, so I understand that I'm missing a bunch of background on the Chee and Leaphorn characters and my overall enjoyment might be hindered. However, of the 350 pages or so of this book, at least 50 could be eliminated due to the repetitive writing. The same bits of story being told two or even three times for no apparent reason. I found myself wondering, again and again, if I had already gone over something only to realize that yes, I had!I am all for a story languidly and specifically unwinding toward its conclusion, as this one does. I think, however, that it needs to be done with some forward momentum and it needs to be able to maintain a certain level of interest for the reader. The writing here is weak and the story, not just obvious, is really just kind of boring.I am looking forward to trying out another title in Hillerman's canon with better results.
__label__2 (Based on a) True Story: Hey readers out there. I just looked this book up because the November 24 edition of the Los Angeles Times ran the true amazing story of this incident. I guess now I'll have to read the book. When I do I'll come back with my review. You can get the LA Times on-line.
__label__1 a great disappointment: The plug into the GPS 276c will not stay connected with the gps on a table or upright on the boat; where I planned on using the etrac. Both the a/c adapter and the car charger have the same attachment plug; I returned both to Amazon when I returned from Central America.
__label__1 Cibo Matto has made an incredibly boring album: Having heard the decent track by Cibo Matto "Sci-fi Wasabi" on a CMJ sampler, I bought STEREOTYPE A thinking it might have other songs in the same vein. Much to my dismay, it honestly is a boring album. Nearly the songs sound the same, and the singing of Miho Hatori and Yuka Honda is inept and lazy.Cibo Matto, like several other Japanese artists (most notably Towa Tei), tried to use the American fascination with seemingly alien culture to sell this album. In the end, all one gets is a collection of 14 yawn-inducing filler-pop tracks. It has no redeeming qualities, and I would recommend that people would find much more worthy music to spend their money on.
__label__1 You've got to be kidding!: Why would they release such a complete mess like SciFi Wasabi as a single?...completely turns me away from wanting to hear the rest. Musically and lyrically a disaster. I'd rather sit through karaoke night at the local drinking dive.
__label__2 Better Than the First: But not as revolutionary as the first album "Viva La Woman." I bought this CD being told it was like the Beastie Boys were women. That was a lie; but Cibo Matto is crazy like the Beastie Boys. Their music is sometimes Electronica, sometimes Alternative, sometimes just plain weird. The weird part makes sense because Shaun Lennon has an influence of this band. One track reminded me of John Lennon's Revolution 9 in that both still give me nightmares. Number 9, number 9...
__label__2 Excellent Movies: I saw Mission Impossible I when it first came out in theaters, and did not watch it again until I bought this double disk set. I enjoyed it just as much if not more than it's incredible sequel. Both movies together, even though they are very loosely related, add up to a great buy.
__label__1 Rust problems: This is a great kettle with one serious flaw. My kettle has started rusting inside the spout after 1 year. There is a lip where the spout joins the base and water is caught there after use.
__label__2 A delicious spiritual journey.: For all those who have been, are, or are going to embark on a spiritual shopping spree, Mick Browns "A Spiritual Tourist" is a delicious rendering of one journalists journey. He remains scheptical and distanced from his subject matter throughout. Though on the odd occasion he cannot help but get involved and be affected by the people he meets. From the appearence of "verbati" in London, to joining the throngs that sit at the feet of Si Baba, (though I did find this chapter long winded) to a meeting with the Dali Lama and the Theosophical society, to crosses appearing on the windows of a church in the United States and his final chapter, which I perticularly enjoyed, being a visit to a Buddist centre in England, his journey is informative, honest and inspiring. I thouroughly enjoyed every minuite and found many of his conclusions enlightening.
__label__1 Raises good questions, but was it edited?: Was this book edited? I think the publisher should be ashamed. If you can slog through the grammatical errors, typos and generally poor writing, you might find this book interesting. However, given that it appears to have been unedited, and given that folks in-the-know have pointed out technical inaccuracies to me, I wouldn't take anything written in this book as the gospel truth. It did raise some interesting questions that I will research.I will think twice before buying a book from this publisher again.
__label__2 ellery queen mysteriesa: This was a very different type of book from what i'm usesd to. It was very goog.I am a big fan of ellery queen.
__label__2 A very nice shoe: I bought this more for fashion than function, but it has both. It is a very comfortable shoe, and very durable. It is also really nice looking.
__label__2 Great running shoe but why is price way up?: The double-edged sword of rating a product highly: you help out fellow shoppers but then the vendor raises the price. I bought this exact shoe 1-1/2 yrs ago for $45 w/free Super-Saver shipping. Now the shoe costs $73 + shipping? Maybe we should all keep our mouths shut. And what's w/the different pricing for different sizing? Sounds like discrimination to me. Could be a federal offense.I've given it 5 stars to see how much higher the price rises.
__label__2 A classic: It was just as good as I remembered! The grand kids (2&4) sat mesmerized for the entire movie! Ttkhanks for the nice afternoon!
__label__2 So sweet!: Kept my 2 year old interested which is hard to do!!! The ending is. Little weird bc it feels lime something is missing but cute movie overall!
__label__1 Forced previews: The movie is fine, but the DVD has previews of other movies that cannot be skipped over. Please don't pay money to support this practice. If you pay for the movie, you shouldn't have to pay again by watching ads.
__label__2 A perfect film: "Babe" comes the closest to being a perfect film out of anything I've seen. Everything in the film should be there, and nothing seems to be missing -- the funny touches with the mice, the love between Babe and Farmer Hogget, the themes on family and self-identity -- any adult or child can watch this movie and love it.
__label__1 Not Good At All: This is the WORST movie I have EVER seen. We had to see it in our class one day. The teacher said that I HAD to watch. Reluctantly, I sat down. I hated it. She fast forwarded it to the middle so we could see the end. Even that part was bad, and I didn't see all of it! I'd give it -10 stars for horrible scenes, cruelty to animals, and lack of trying. DON'T SEE IT EVER!!!
__label__2 No Skip-Ahead function on this DVD: BABE is a wonderful movie, but this DVD does not allow the viewer to skip thru the previews. Once the movie begins you can skip around, but you have to sit thru a bunch of previews EVERY TIME your kid watches this movie.
__label__2 Dundee II: Very good sequel. Moderate amount of action & an actual plot unlike many new movies. If you own the first this is a definite addition to your video home library
__label__1 Non-stick Coating Wore Off and is Chipping After Three Months: I bought this pan with high expectations given the strong reviews from other customers but after a few months of use I am very disappointed. The pan takes several coats of oil to prevent food from sticking and now the non-stick surface is beginning to flake off. I always washed the pan by hand and never used anything other than plastic cooking utensils. The last non-stick pan I had was Kirkland brand and it lasted four years.
__label__2 Oldie and Goodie: My father got me hooked on these books. They are extremely well written and just fun to read. Anyone who just wants a good mystery without all the sex and swearing will love these books.
__label__2 Excellent stuff!: This face wash is great, it's light, foaming, and again, in the first 24 hours of using the exuviance products, there is a noticeable difference in my skin texture and overall look. It's amazing! My Proactive is going away, and I'm all over this stuff now.
__label__1 Worse than surgery: The jokes in this book are not only unfunny, they are not worthy of actually being called jokes. I have flipped through many of the pages in search of a good laugh and haven't found anything remotely close. I rarely post reviews. Out of curiosity I looked up this book on Amazon and saw someone posted 5 stars.This person is clinically insane.I am _that_ driven to post just to bring the average rating down. You will get more laughs with your seven dollars by renting Les Miserables.
__label__2 Amazing but not his best: This is Jimi's most famous performance, maybe since its included in the most famous concert ever. Still, there are better concerts of Jimi than this one. It takes him and the band almost all of disc one to warm up. On Red house, Larry Lee plays the lead guitar, so believe me, any other live version of Red House is better than this one. But just as the concert is near its end, Jimi starts playing Star Splanged banner and makes everything worthwile. This is one of rock most memorable moments, one of those that youll have stuck in your mind no matter what, like Elvis playing Ed Sullivan, or the Beatles coming to America. So, from that track till the end of CD2 youll hear nothing but some of the best music ever recorded. Now, if you can get the Monterrey CD on a second hand shop, that is Jimi's best performance ever. Or get Band of gipsys instead.
__label__1 poor: The product did not operate as stated on the box. The supplier CDROMUSA wasn't at all helpful and left me with a product I'm unable to use; so they got FREE money and refused to send a replacement.They don't deserve a star at all, but the one star represents the nice, deceptive packaging.
__label__2 movies that make you THINK: How many times in our lives have we wanted a "do over" in our lives thinking if we could just "change" one of our actions things would have been so much better in our present day lives. These movies make you realize, life can never be perfect no matter how many times you could try!
__label__1 Overpriced and too many restrictions on use: This item is very overpriced. I ordered it because I wanted the very best, and I thought I would get what I paid for, but it is no different than other pans a half the price. Also, the information sheet that accompanied the pan had so many restrictions and warranty cop-outs that if followed would make the pan almost unusable.
__label__2 My recommended buy: Had bought a set of the Anolon Advanced Hard Anodized Nonstick cookware, but it did not include a 2 qt. covered Saucepan.This size is something I use a lot. I love the lighter weight than the 14 yr. old set we had. The rubberized handle and lid are great.I love the glass lid and the nonstick finish is great! Clean-up is very easy. I don't use high heat as directed, but do boil in the saucepanwithout any damage being noted. I highly recommend this size pan and the whole set. It is less expensive than some of the more popularbrands, but I like the look and function better. I am a very satisfied customer.
__label__1 Not good at all!: This book actually pokes on Henry's contemporaries and describes series of events which will eventaully lead to a horrendous headache to be suffered by the reader. On the other hand, Fielding's Tom Jones is a delight and mustn't be missed at any cost! This book is a total waste, though!
__label__1 A Disappointment: I've long been a fan of Robert B. Parker Spenser books but, even though I watched them, I didn't really care much for the Robert Urich "Spenser for Hire" series. Too 'goody two-shoes' and 'television-ized.' That's why, when I found these Joe Mantegna movies, I enthusiastically thought that someone made some Spenser movies that were a little more 'raw' and true to the books. What a disappointment! The stories were accurate enough, but Joe Mantegna as Spenser? A former cop and boxer? I don't THINK so! I found him, and the actors filling the roles of Hawk and Susan to be completely unbelievable and wrong for the parts. These movies really made me MISS the Robert Urich series!
__label__2 The Power of the Witch: I loved this book. It's very informitive. I like the fact that my friend, who is very far from being pagan, read it and understood it. It does exactly what the man behind the counter told me it would do. TEACH. I even email Laurie and told her how much I loved it.
__label__1 Not Impressed by Cabot: I expected great things from Cabot's books. I was let down. I did not care for her writing style, nor did I find her information moving or educational. I am genuinely surprised that so many people find Cabot to be a literary value. I just don't see it. I would not recommend Cabot's works to anyone interested in paganism or witchcraft.
__label__1 A guide to one-night stands: This book is confusing and difficult to follow because the author tries to cover one-night-stands and polygynous dating with the same advice. Basically, you will probably get laid using these tips, but the type of woman you will reel in may not be the type you'd want to see again... ever.For example, what do you think happens when you use money as an incentive to control womens' behavior? She is going to use sex in a similar fashion to control you. Unless she's an idiot. But hey, if you read this book with the goal of getting laid, you're probably into that.
__label__1 Not entirely original...: Actually everything in the book IS helpful, and a OK read... but most of the material is FREE on the net already.The stuff from "The Layguide" was mirrored on all kinds of websites all over the place before it ever became print. If you search for keywords like "layguide" and "player guide" on the net, you will find this stuff is basically plagaurized. It was just a compilation of a bunch of usenet posts.Now, if you really want something in print, and original too, do yourself a favor now and go buy "The Art of Seduction" by Robert Greene, also available here on Amazon.com. The guy researched great seducers and seductions throughout history, and came up with types of seducers, the stages of seduction, etc. And his work is entirely original as well.
__label__1 Some reasonable advice.: I like the book but its a bit over the top in places.There is some good advice and if used sensibly is okay.Its a good book.I recommend these,also available from this site:1)"U.S.S."(Undercover Sex signals")By Leil Lowndes.2)"How to pick up girls!" By Eric Weber.3)"How to meet the right woman" By Roger Ratcliff,David Conaway & Diana Ohlsson.4)"How to pick up(get dates with)beautiful women:secrets every man should know".By John Eagan,B.A.5)"Understanding women:The definitive guide to meeting,dating and dumping,if necessary.By Romy Miller.
__label__1 Read The Art of Seduction instead: This is amateur stuff. If you want to get really useful and ground-breaking stuff, read The Art of Seduction:[...]I know that it's long and a bit academic in tone, but it is the last word on Seduction in the modern age. True seduction is not just a one-shot, get-laid-tonight approach (although it can certainly include that). Read The Art of Seduction, and you will be well on your way to having women desire you to a degree that is truly shocking. I am a true believer, and I owe the author Robert Greene a debt that cannot be repaid. It is mind-boggling how much women really want to be carried away by their desire. Arm yourself with an understanding based on Greene's book, and you'll be well on your way.
__label__1 For anyone else, 4 stars. For Laura, it's her nadir.: Wishywashy cause-proclamation from a once brilliant tunesmith and vocalist. It's okay to buy into feminism, tree-hugging and wicca in one's personal life, but to create an album on a major label about this stuff, to slow and barely tuneful music is a major mistake. If you're unfamiliar with Laura Nyro, this is not the place to begin. Try "Eli and the Thirteenth Confession," "The First Songs" or pretty much anything else. Leave this one for Gloria Steinem or the next PETA convention.
__label__1 One of the worst spokeseman for my party..: Let this illogical hack please not defend my party, and makea case against the liberals. She doesn't get it, and makesso many ridiculous arguments that don't hold up.Her writing style is horrendous. Please do not wastetime on this book. I would give this rating a negative 2 starsif I could.
__label__2 better than the swiffer: I love the simplee clean microfiber swivel mop. It is bigger and easier to use than the swiffer and you don't have to keep buying replacement sheets...just wash and go. A much more environmental and financial choice than other cleaning options.
__label__2 My floors are always cleaned with a CLEAN mop now!: I do think this item works great as a mop and as a dust mop, it really picks up all of the hair, fuzz and dust. Sadly(this is why it isn't 5 stars), corners and edges will find you using a regular broom, instead of this gadget, as it just can't handle those areas. I love that I can throw the pads in the washer and let them air dry -- no more mopping with anything less than clean.
__label__1 Depends on your situation: I bought this along with the authors' grammar reference, which has proven an expensive mistake. The two are college level texts and probably quite good for those engaged in intellectual pursuits. I, on the other hand, teach ESL as a volunteer and was simply looking to shore up my practical knowledge of the subjects. Both texts contain virtually no such information. In fact, they assume a significant knowledge of linguistics and linguistic theory; they are literally packed with obscure jargon that I presume familiar to some set of initiates but certainly far beyond my ken. If your situation is analogous to mine, I suggest Side by Side Spanish & English Grammar and Practice Makes Perfect English Pronouns and Prepositions--much less expensive ($30 the pair I think) and much more practical.
__label__2 Does a good job: Mach3 does a fine shaving job, and it's better than the cheap razors you find at the supermarket. They're durable (although not as much as I'd like). I believe that Mach3 cartridges are more widely available than Schick Quatro cartridges, and that the 4 blades were overkill (let's wait for the 7-blade razor to see how that works)Also with Amazon's Subscribe & Save feature, they arrive at my door with discount and I never run out of them. Nice!
__label__2 Works just fine, but not cheap at all: I get 4-5 shaves with each razor, after that it causes pimples. I find it too expensive, but there is no better alternative.
__label__1 Horrible Shaving System: I purchased the razor and blades as the double-bladed sensor was out of stock. This is the worst design Gillette has yet put forth. The 3-blade design is much too wide and clumsy. The only shaving done with this razor system was my first layer of skin.
__label__1 Mach3 or crap3: Very poor quality, blade feels blunt and scrapes rather than cuts..I used a whole pack of 8 in 1 week, each blade was only good for 1 shave. Dont waste your money
__label__1 Somehow not as good as Birks: They run MUCH smaller than Birkenstocks. I sent the size 44 back (which is comfy in the comparable model in Birkenstocks; is it the Boston?) and got the 45 and it STILL feels small. The upper is ok, the shoe isn't the best made thing but is adequate; it's just the size thing that bothered me.
__label__2 Very Nice!: My wife and I go on vacation only once a year but this is perfect for the beach. It's also nice to walk on the board walk or in surf shops.
__label__2 good piece of collection: This video reflects the early years of Pink Floyd. In that time a bunch of innovative guys, mainly Syd probably because his use of sychedelic stuff, trying to bring something new in terms of music. If you are a real fan this would be very rare and interesting but if you expect the late sound of PF with Waters and Gilmour maybe you will feel quite shocked. I rated it 4 because is a short document and the sound is not the best although for this kind of information this is not important, the real value of the video is to see them in the context of a very important moment in the history of pop music.
__label__1 Garbage!!!: I'll keep it short and sweet. This product is garbage. I purchased a vinyl cover to further protect the item, but it became a rust bucket and fell to pieces. The company's response: we'll send you $50. Nice. Don't waste your time & money. Keep looking.
__label__2 Superb Short Stories!: This book is a delightful surprise, with a wide range of well-crafted short stories sure to entertain any fan of the genre.A few of them resonate with the reader long after the book's finished, particularly a tale involving the history of a backwoods baptismal pool, and a married couple's slow and sweet farewell after the wife is diagnosed with a terminal illness. I'll read them again after a year or two- the ultimate compliment to a short story collection!
__label__1 Update of the old book: It was a rather frustrating book since it was just an update of the previous generation book for VC++ 6.0. It seems that SAMS wanted to be the first to sell in order to sell. This is rather bad for the company since it will lose many of its potential customers in the future. The only chapters worth reading, well at least a little bit, are chapters 19 and 21 and nothing more.
__label__1 Clapton masterpices: I'm a big fan of Eric Clapton and his music dating from the Yardbirds forward. He's done a tremendous body of work. Unfortunately you won't find much here worth buying. The overall content and quality are pretty poor. Rather than masterpieces this more like the stuff left (for good reason) out of many other DVD's covering his work.
__label__2 Long Walk to Freedom: Ever since their emergence on Paul Simon's Graceland, the unique harmonies and rhythms have kept me enthtralled. The notable thing about this CD is how their famous guests adapt to their sound, choice of material, and blend is solid. Some collaborations work better than others. Mellissa Ethridge and Natalie Merchant are two standouts. This a worthwhile introduction this group.
__label__1 slow moving, pretentious and out of date: If you are a fan of apocalyptic fiction, there are many better books to read than this. While I did finish it, i found it slow moving (very slow), Pretentious in language, and very out of date in the effects of war. I think the real message was about the value of civil defense. An interesting point, but the author, writing in the mid-50's was talking about efftects of atomic bombings that are much milder than true. Totally unrealistic.
__label__2 A very beautiful coffee table book...: I love the book...couldn't be more pleased with everything! I know I'll treasure this book for the rest of my life and will share it with my friends and family...because it will live on the coffee table in my sunroom for everyone to see!
__label__2 worth the wait: It's great to finally see this album released on CD. I've wanted this for a long time. Hot on the heels of the "Biggest Prize in Sport" album, this was released by Polydor in the USA clearly with the idea of riding the cresting new wave. Sure, it was probably 999's most "commercial" album but listeners are treated to some great catchy hard rockin' songs. No, it's not punk but these guys never were really prime safety pin disciples. A very consistent album. Sing along! And what a great live band they were!
__label__1 Not as expected: Unfortunately the bouncing mechanism is not strong enough to bounce the baby's entire body. When my 9 lb. baby was in there only her feet were bouncing. It did not create the same feeling that she gets when I bounce a "regular" bouncer with my foot. A huge disappointment! I returned it.
__label__2 Great Book on the Best Computer: This is a great book on the inventor of the Apple Computer. I have read it several times and done a couple of book reports on it. I highly recommend it.
__label__1 Make sure product is for your GPS: I recommend the product if it is for your specific GPS!I purchased a Garmin GPS 76CSX, and Amazon said people who buy this product also buy, and all the also buys were for different model GPS's and did not work with that unite, so be careful when ordering.
__label__1 Garmin 276C Power Cord: The powercord sent was a straight connection rather than the 90 degree one and would not stay plugged in to the unit. I wish I would of tried it before cutting and soldering to my motorcycle connection. Tis junk and can't use it. Money wasted.
__label__1 THE CABLE IS DIFERENT TO THE PHOTO: THE CABLE IT'S NO SAME TO THE PHOTO, DO NOT HAVE A TERMINAL CIGARETTE CONNECTOR, I LOST MY MONEY. I think you wrong the part, I receive Part No. RB, have a wiring diagram for make a Gilsson RB cable for install a DB-9 serial connector, but no, I buy to you other cable whit 12 volt adapter cable.
__label__2 Great gift Idea--they love it!: I bought this for my grandson who loves NCIS. He was so tickled. He is collecting the series.
__label__2 another good season for an already great show: this is a solid season with several great episodes. the characterization is some of the best. it's not quite the same as we've lost Kate and gained Ziva, but the dynamics and chemistry really develop well. if you like season 1 and 2 you'll like 3 as well.
__label__2 3rd season of NCIS: This was a interesting season for the show. Everytime you watch the show you learn and see something different.
__label__1 Very disappointed: The NCIS movie i ordered came in in a timely manner. It was in the condition stated at the time of purchase. These are the things i am very pleased with. Not having watched this series on tv as we do not have cable or an atenna in our home i was unaware of the skanky nature of this season. The intellegence and absence of immorality that i have seen on the few episodes i watched outside the home caused me to purchase. I am extremely disappointed in this episode and the following one. The rounchyness far out weighed the intellegence by far. Now i am very very leary about purchasing any other episodes. I did enjoyed episode one which i borrowed from my neice. The moral deploriaty is why we do not have cable or an atenna in our house. These have gone to the trash as is fitting for such lack of marality.
__label__2 Season 3 is great!: Continuing right where Season 2 left off with the murder of Agent Todd, the team adds 2 new members to their cast. The new director is named Jenny and has a previous relationship with Gibbs and the new agent is named Ziva.
__label__2 A feast for the ears: I have had this album, yes the hard vynl thing, since 1981. Now we can get these great works of art right on our pcs. My favorite as always been Bouree. I think this is one of the neatest pieces ever written. I love the images it invokes. Strap those head phones on and be transported into the romance of dancers in veils and moonlit desert nights.
__label__2 Law: Gives a great overall view of this modern type career for both men and women. Provides the nuts and bolts of the career.
__label__1 Terribly Dissappointed: I had watched this version when I first got it but must have missed the missing Coral Sea parts for some reason. It jumps from the scene where Rochfort has told Garth about Operation AF (Coral Sea) to where they are telling Rochfort that they had a rough time at the battle!Some really great scenes are missing in this verison. Hope that they release a full version sometime soon. Its a shame that this movie was so downgraded from the original.Bottom line: dont waste your money. Wait, wait, wait for them to put out the Full "Real" Collector's Edition.I note that the "added for TV" scenes seem to be more personal and probably added for the ladies but weren't they in the theater version too? I seem to remember seeing the scene with Garth and his girlfriend talking at their apartment before he leaves in theater. Perhaps age is starting to show ... in me! :)
__label__2 Great flick: I took my father to see this movie in theaters back when it was released in the 70's. He was a Marine who served in the Pacific and told ne how important this battle was. I needed to have it in my collection.
__label__2 Close...: This is a close fictionalized movie of the beginning of WWII. It is interesting and a great flick to share.
__label__1 terrible: Continues to freeze movie and my TV . Will not purchase streaming movies again. Useless .suggest no one get this .
__label__2 Great flick: Good movie, one of a very few on the battle of Midway. The additional storyline a Japanese love interest was distracting, however.
__label__1 Profanity Galore - This is not the TV Version: If you loved watching this on TV as a child you will be surprised at the language in this version. If you are sensitive to profanity - don't get it.
__label__2 Midway: I have never received this item. It was first mis-delivered (not to me) and never arrived. Now, it has not been sent.As for the movie, I've seen it more than once. It's a great movie. Just wish I could get it delivered. Can you help me out?
__label__2 Midway: Very well done. Both on the part of the Japanese war plans, as well as our own. I lived in that era and remember the situation very well. I would recommend this movie to all aages.
__label__1 Poorest war movie ever made: 'Midway' on DVD while we're still waiting for 'The Longest Day'- somebody's got to be kidding. This one really sucks. Here we go: stock-shots ripped off from 'Thirty seconds over Tokyo', 'Tora Tora Tora' and probably other movies, WWII newsreels footage extensively cropped to fit into the Panavision frame, meaningless cameos by various aging stars -probably to make the flick look like a blockbuster- , historical mistakes and countless errors about planes and aircraft carriers, inept dramatization -the predictable romance between Heston's son and a Japanese girl-, you name it. The only reason I give this awful turkey one star is because the software doesn't allow me to give it none.
__label__2 A classic war film. Very underated.: People complain about how this film uses some of the same historic footage "Tora Tora Tora" uses. This WWII footage is great and should be used in different war films. Just because it was used in that film dosent mean it can't be used in "Midway". It's not like they took scenes made for "Tora Tora Tora" and put them in this film. Historic footage is used and reused in many films. How many times have we seen scenes with President Kennedy in different films? The same populer footage of him? This film is an epic war masterpiece. The acting is superb. People complain about the Japanese speaking English. You are supposed to imagine them to be speaking Japanese. It's not like a mistake the film makers made that makes the film appear cheaper or something. This film gets very little credit, and is always in the shadow of "Tora Tora Tora". I think, if you collect war films, you should own both. "Midway" is a true classic.
__label__1 I had a great expectation for this...: What would you get if you took a bad script, uninspired acting, WW2 stock footage, scenes from Tora! Tora! Tora!, and put it in a blender and mixed it around? The answer: Midway! This reeaallly bad movie suffers from everything. WW2 stock footage is over-used (most of it didn't even take place during the battle of Midway) and the scenes from Tora! Tora! Tora! are out of place. A corny love interest gets in the way of the action too much. Lot's of familiar faces in this, but their acting is uninspired, and the script is dreadful. About 30 minutes of important footage was cut out of the original release (including the battle of the Coral Sea). Please, avoid this film!
__label__2 the best: its the best music i have heard in some time. if you are in to world music or just looking for some thing diferent , well it does not get much better then this.
__label__2 Intense, vibrant: Pure hardcore party vibes here,..with infectuous spirits that can intoxicate. Rockin' tunes include "Legalize it"' "Downpressor Man" and a fantastic "Get Up, Stand Up." Hard and fat bass lines, solid drumming and vocal chants work to induce a tribal fever and a mood to celebrate life.
__label__1 Like being at a drive in...: The film played on countless "dusk till dawn" horror bills at drive-ins through the early 80's, and this disc does a pretty good job of taking th viewer back to those long gone days of cheap thrills. The picture and sound quality are only about average, just like the drive-in, the only other thing you need is for someone to park their car outside you living room and honk thier horns during the nude scenes. And the movie? Well it's about average as well. The plot concerns a plot to get an inheritance and a bunch of greedy heirs. A true B movie on all counts, but not without a certain trashy value, those who spent warm summer nights watching this flick when it was paired up with the likes of "Don't Answer the Phone," and "Point of Terror" may want to give this reasonably priced disc a look.
__label__2 Excellent Look into African American History: I just completed this novel and I must say that it was excellent. It was quite obvious that the author had done extensive research into her subject matter. It was a poignant look into history and how African American women had to struggle in a world where they were often looked upon as inferior. Everything from the descriptions to dialogue was well-written and I look forward to reading more of Ms. Singleton's work.
__label__1 n/a: Who is Joe Nickell? What are his qualifications for these research endeavors and the knowledge to properly assess all parameters involved in scientific research?
__label__1 Set of 2 40" Hardwood Datio Bokken Practice Sword: I bought these for myself and my son for Aikido weapons training. They are not very well made and appear to have been factory seconds. To clarify there are cracks in both to point that they might easily break and splinter. One is practically straight with no curve. The handles are nicely wrapped but the wrapping tends to come off with use. There is also removable plastic guard or tsuba, which is not very functional and more decorative. You get what you pay for and these are not high quality, hence the expensive price. I will eventually buy something better.
__label__1 Cheap, and it shows.: I got these as a gift for a friend, so that we may have some fun sparring. However, one sword came with a large crease in the wood that proved to break open after only a couple hours of use. They also had a strange, chemical-y smell to them for quite a while.They can still be good display pieces, but I would recommend getting synthetic swords if you plan on seriously using them; the extra cost is worth their durability.
__label__2 Christmas present: Love these practice swords I have purchased some before and my son just plain wore them out. These are for Christmas and I already know he will love them...
__label__2 Victum Of Sinility: Ironically, while doing an update to the catalog of my movie library, I ran across this one and decided to watch it this evening - having no recollection of it. I see that it has great review ratings from other owners, and their details I will leave to you to peruse.This is a great mystery drama. Don't miss it.Regards,EdB
__label__2 Justifiable Revenge: I Think that Camille Keaton handled the attack with as much diginity as she could muster up, what she does afterward to each of them is well deserved.Rape and nude scenes so please beware, this 8o's film was raw and has become a true classic in the vein of Charles Bronson's 10 to midnight. This is a classic, get it while you can.
__label__2 A classic of its kind: This movie is a classic of its kind and much better that a lot of movies, that followed. It is not one of the best, but it still deserves five stars...
__label__1 WATCH A WOMAN GET RAPED, BEAT, & TERRORIZED. OH HOW FUN...: I watched this when I was a young girl & it still haunts me to this day. If you enjoy watching a woman get viciously raped for almost an hour then this is the movie for you.
__label__1 Based On A True Story?: Based on a true story? If this is true then it is more horrible than being a fictional fantasy. Did anyone witness this woman being raped? People are just going on a murder's word that she was rape by these men. They didn't have the DNA Test back then and when it did come about a lot of women were found guilty of lying about being raped.Since when is it all right for anyone to take the law into their own hands? I guess it was 1978 when it started for women or maybe before. You would never say it was okay for a man to murder a woman no matter what she did to him. This is sexist and sick.
__label__1 0 STARS: Talk about rubbish...you want to talk about rubbish?: Be honest people, this is not a horror movie or a scary movie...this is just pure garbage. What cinematic value does this movie have to offer? ZERO. I am all for horror movies, but this movie just is not horror, scary or even shocking...it's just lame! It is about the raping of a girl and she gets revenge. WOW, what a worthless...waste.
__label__1 Has live grain bugs: I received my order a couple of weeks ago. The shipment has live bugs -- Sawtooth Grain Beetles. I have had to move the bag from my pantry to the garage. I have sealed it and placed it in a closed can but still not sure how to kill them without contaminating the seeds. Usually I place a bay leaf on the top of any grain to keep bugs out. This bag was received with live bugs already in the shipment. The seeds sprout okay after rinsing them so they deserve at least one star.
__label__2 The Book of Vodou: Charms and Rituals to Empower Your Life: For such a little book, it is quite informative.I bought a copy when it was first published around 10 years ago & found myself reading & referring to it many many times. I've had an interest in Vodou for many years & like some that didn't grow up in Haiti or anyplace where Vodou is present, "The Book Of Vodou" is a great introduction.This book's is a very appealing glimpse into a beautiful religion that is often misunderstood. It has great photographs throughout & is straight & to the point about the origins & history of Vodou from West Africa all the way up to the present day without information overload.I have been a practioner of "The Arts" for many years, as well as a historian & there's not one negative thing I can say about this book. It's one of my favourite books on Vodou & in fact, I'm on my fourth copy!If you any interest in Vodou, start with this book! You will not be disappointed.
__label__1 Discover a beautiful region of France: If you want to discover a beautiful and wild French region through the eyes of a Scottish writer, read Travels with a donkey. Stevenson, before he became famous, depicted his journey in the cevennes, with his donkey "Modestine". Rediscover the excellent style of a young writer about to become world-wide-known.
__label__2 Awesome: I had a lot of trouble finding this C D. I look over the internet for couple of hours until I came upon Amazon. Not only did I find what I was looking for, but bought the C D for a price I did not think could possible. Thanks! Love this Awesome C D.
__label__2 LOve it!: I have really curly, thich & frizzy hair. I found this product @ a local beauty supply store and LOVE it!!! I now have soft, flowing, shiny, beautiful curls. I used to need mousse, curl enhancers and tons of products to wear my curls. Since I started using this product I can just spray some leave in conditioner and I am good to walk out the door :) I usually apply it 2-3x's a wk over night and just rinse out in the morn (no shampoo).
__label__1 disappointed: i loved the original poster i lost due to a move, i decieded to replace it and ordered this poster but when i recieved it it was NOT black and white but black and blue.
__label__1 Not a Great Book: I was a little surprised by the content of this book. It is really not a book I would recommend. It is about a Grandma who takes her grandkid to the beach and nothing goes right. Then it ends. I thought it could have been more meaningful.
__label__2 Finally, I can style my own hair!: I've read many reviews on this site -- some negative, some positive. I have A LOT of hair. My hair is full of texture. My hair doesn't grow down (length), it grows out (wide.) I WOULD NEVER USE A HAIR DRYER BEFORE! I couldn't unless I wanted to look like a clown. This product is the first product that allows me to dry my hair. The product does get very hot! That is what my hair needs to become straight and manageable, however. If you don't have frizzy and unruly hair, this is product was NOT made for you. I, however, must say FINALLY!!
__label__1 Infiniti by Conair BC173: I have shoulder length curly, fine hair. I followed the directions for use and I ended up with a messy head of frizzy hair. The brush does more blowing than straightening in my opinion - it is fine for drying hair. But I did not get the sleek, smooth, shiny effect that was promised by the straightening tool. It was nothing like the salon straightening job I normally get. I will be returning this styler ASAP. Very unhappy.
__label__1 Twice the effort for half the sleekness: My hair is about 90% straight and 10% wavy, so you wouldn't think it takes much to make it sleek, straight and shiny; I even use an ant-firzz serum before I style. But using this Conair took twice as long as drying and straightening my hair in two steps, and gave me half as straight hair. I even used my regular blow dryer first to get most of the dampness out, thinking this would speed up the process...but no, it took ages. The Conair is basically a very small hairdryer with a few brush bristles. When I was finished, my hair definitely had frizz and fly aways, and I had to go back over it with my Chi flat iron. I really wanted to like this product and to save time, but I will be returning it.
__label__1 not worth it: If you have never used a flat iron before, don't even bother.This product does not come even close to the results I get when i use my flat iron. A waste of money, to say the least.
__label__2 Works well for thick hair if you have the time...: I have really thick shoulder length hair. I only wash my hair twice a week and once my hair is dry and straightened, I don't need to do a thing with it. This product works really well for me as long as I have the time to spare. I takes me at least 30 or 40 minutes to dry and straighten my hair once it has been towel dried. I bought this product because I didn't want to spend the money for more expensive similar items. I think that for the price....the infiniti is well worth it.
__label__2 Conair Straightener: I have very thick, very wavy hair. Thie straightener works well on my hair. It is easy to use. It also does not take a week to get my hair dried. I cut my hair to shoulder length and found it does work better than on long hair, although I did get it to work on my long hair too. I am very pleased with this product. I definately recommend it.
__label__1 Does not perform the functions advertised.: This hair dryer claims to style, smooth and streighten. Don't count on it. I have medium lenghth fine hair and I wish I never bought it. However, it might work on longer hair? Not a high probability. Forget this product and empty promises.
__label__1 Stopped working after second use: The dryer worked fine but I only use a hair dryer occasionally so I'd only used it twice in 6 weeks. When I went to use it the third time, it was deader than a doornail. No power. I guess the stress of sitting in the cabinet for a few weeks was too much for it. Too late to return it. I've seen other reviews with a similar problem so it seems they have some quality control issues to work out and if you buy one, it's the luck of the draw if you get a 'good' one or not. I'm generally very pleased with my purchases through Amazon...but this one was a dud.
__label__1 Not what I was hoping for: I was really hoping for a dryer that would get rid of some of the frizz and curls I started getting when I turned 30 - an unexpected and unwelcome byproduct of aging. This seemed perfect, but the dryer is so weak, it takes forever to dry my hair and virtually no straightening effect. After using it, I still have to straighten my hair with a flat iron. So I've gone back to drying my hair with a regular dryer (more power and therefore faster) and using the flat iron. I guess I should have known it sounded too good to be true.
__label__1 Baffled: I ordered it, thinking it was something else, and then when it arrived, I was intrigued and had to try it. Okay, it will straighten but not certain the point of it. I can't use it to curl the ends and it seems a flat iron would do a better job. I used it once, didn't like it. Tried it the second time to see if I just wasn't using it right, and still wasn't thrilled. It is now in my dead heap pile of unused hair gadgets.
__label__1 Disappointing at best: Sadly, I had high hopes for this little wonder, but it didn't deliver. It is difficult to maneuver and not powerful enough to blow out my short flippy style.
__label__2 Love this thing!!: I have moderatly curly hair and have never known how to style it. I am uncoordinated with flat irons and round brushes with hair dryers. This thing is awsome. I can easily style my hair straight and not feel like I need an extra hand. It is adjustable depending how curly your hair is. It is easily packable for traveling. Apply straightning product, if desired, after you wash, then style when your hair is about two thirds dry, or if you wash your hair at night, just dampen it a little in the AM and style.
__label__2 Good ink: I bought this to replace my Omas black ink that was running out to use in my Lamy 2000 fountain pen. The ink flows fine and gives even coverage on the two kind of paper I commonly use, I would definitely recommend it. The ink lost one star because it is a dark, dark grey rather than a true black as was the Omas but only suffers when held right next to one another. I don't know if this is due to the paper I am using. Also it seems this ink drys a little slower and thus smudges somewhat easier, this is NOT an objective measurement however but a feeling and obviously will depend on the paper used.
__label__1 Too thin: I purchased this after reading the great reviews and information at the manufacturer's website. This ink is waterproof. But it is also very thin, permeates nibs and runs all over the metal part of the nib. If you use a paper that is not very absorbent it may work, or on checks. But on normal paper, it flares and distorts writing. The color when dried is not totally black but a dark gray.
__label__2 Great ink!: A few weeks ago, I bought a few disposable fountain pens to see if I liked them, and after a few days, I began using them as my primary pens. The problem was that they had (very) bad ink in them, so when I ran out of ink, I decided to attempt to refill them with Noodler's ink-- and it worked! This stuff is pitch black, and best of all, it doesn't bleed or "feather" when you're writing with it.Works well in:Pilot Varsity Disposable Fountain Pen Assorted Ink 7-Pack Pouch (90029)
__label__1 Structurally sound but: This is a good binder. I only did not work for me because the width only is enough to fit 8.5 x 11 sheets of paper. If you wish to include tab dividers the will protrude past the width of the binder. Also the expansion is limited in that you start from 3" and expand to 5" inches. The binder cannot collapse smaller than 3". So as long as these two items are not an issue, it is sturdy and durable
__label__1 Immoral movie: This movie could have been so good. The storyline was great and the relationship between Mr. Sorrell & his son is wonderful. However, there were lots of bedroom scenes. Leading character was very immoral and there was language. In the end, the son winds up euthanizing his father after the encouragement of his wife. Very dissapointed
__label__2 Entertaining tribute: The celebration of Duke Ellington a century after his birth has produced a wealth of tributes and, thankfully, some fine reissues of his work. This CD takes a more contemporary approach to Ellington's music resulting in a sort of smooth jazz sampler of the Duke. It's a very entertaining approach with some stellar work by an all-star roster of artists. Well worth a listen.
__label__1 They changed the words!: Don't buy this one either ... Unless you like grooving to the wrong words. I thought I was going to be sent back to the good old days ... Save your money. You won't get a refund! You can't call anyone. I got it "DRY"!
__label__1 poor product: I brought this product 7mths ago and it has been falling apart. Presently one of the legs of the chair has broke( crack into 2 piceces ) .I would like to know how do I go about contact the manufacturer about this matter .
__label__1 she's so dull: She started out as the "German Britney Spears" and somehow she got stuck there. Her songs have no message, no great melody and are absolutely shallow. So is her image. She still stays "clean" (in contrast to Britney) and it extremely boring and superficial (when it comes to stardom - no meant personally)
__label__2 It's finally on DVD!: I've been waiting for this movie to come out on DVD since I first got a DVD player about three years ago. Ray Liotta gives an excellent performance as a man falsely accused of murder trying to find his wife's killer. The plot is very interesting and original and presented so that it is believable and intense. Definitely a must-have.
__label__2 applied the knowladge: i have read this book with a great deal of intrest. it was a great help in implementing change and designing a organization structure that is able to deliver on the new strategy.
__label__2 akjee: the book covers very detailed instructions for the beginners to understand and follow the psychic healing.i have yet to practice and experiance the process
__label__1 A waste of money!!!: I remembered watching this movie as a kid and really enjoying it. However, after rewatching the Transformers Season 1 4 disc DVD set, this movie pales in comparison. The characters lacked personality and didn't look as interesting as the others. I recommend that you save your money and put it towards the more expensive, but more enjoyable, DVD box sets.
__label__1 forgive me.............: Ok, ok, I realize that I am going to be fried for this but here goes.......I loved this movie as a child. I worshiped the TV series and I still have quite the collection of Autobots, and Decepticons. However, when my friend got me this film for my birthday, I watched it and found that it really did not hold my interest anymore. I think this film better served its purpose in the 80's, and is truly lost in today's modern era of animation. I would, however, like to see this film remade with better animation, and a FAR better soundtrack. I love the toys, but I did not like this movie.
__label__2 cursing in this 80's hit movie: For those who jest cant get over the part that there was some cursing in this 80's hit movie please consider that there's was more of that in the live action movie. The same live action movie that you took your stupid little brats to see!!!!!.... get over it! i bet you freak out when bugs bunny dress in Drag too!
__label__2 MATRIX FOREVER!! OUT OF PRINT> AGAIN!!!!!: I can not believe this has gone out of print again. Its the greatest anime movie ever.It always goes through long periods of time being unnavailable. I don't get it.Maybe the next DVD version will be better than this one. This version was great for being uncensored. But the extras were weak. It should have at least had two discs and included the alternate TV version. Or at least its opening Star Wars styled scrollthat replaced the opening credits. The music video "The Touch" was also not included. Also excluded were the animated bumpers narrated by a computer animated "Optimus Prime" that played when the movie aired on television in 5 partson the TV series. They would have made a nice extra.
__label__2 Darryls Review on Transformers 20th Anniversary dvd: Great movie. To date the best version out there. 2 disc! It was great watching it with commentary from fans. This was just awesome. The colour and widescreen format are surperb. Many special features including commentaries, interviews, trailers etc. The Scramble City episode which is a special feature, which I was looking forward to fell below expectations due to the fact you could only watch it with commentary. Only about four toy commercials. There are easter eggs on both discs (old Diaclone toy commercials). Overall a great addition to my dvd collection and fully recommended.
__label__1 Alert alert! Not compatible with Mac!: This DVD disc was not recognized on my Apple PowerBook G3 Firewire. The DVD drive tried to spin the disc up but gave up after a few seconds. There's no DVD icon on the desktop. I tried on both OS 9 and OS X, and "df -k" on OS X did not show a mounted volume in the DVD drive.Since the TF Season 1 Collector's Edition DVD discs play fine on the same laptop, it's got to be the TFTM DVD disc that's mastered non-Macintosh compatible. Major disappointment, since I own the Canadian VHS version of TFTM (containg that four-letter word) and was really looking forward to owning the uncensored edition on DVD.
__label__2 One of the most beautiful creation,In the animation industry: One of best animation in 80's; A now,transformers never die, now we got the beast wars and there transformers too, Well the transformers the movie is a must have. A now, this would be interesting, how about if this was on DVD and animated in 3D computer like the beast wars, Now that would be a creation of gods.
__label__2 Best movie ever: I happy with this purchas it a used product but came in realy good condition I thought it took a lil long to get here but notice that it was from Canada understood why it took a lil while but worth the wait
__label__2 The Decepticons Learn A New Skill: HOW ODD!!!!! just as it really counts the decepticons learn to aim straight managing to wipe out five of the original transformers in one go after numerous attempts. Much as this film is very very good and the music is outstanding. But it has as always all the same tramsformers inconstincies. But much to all our pleasure it has all the wounderful and debonair wit of Starscream that we have all come to know and love and with Leonard Nimoy adding a nice "Edge" to Galvatron... Still all in all a Very Good Purchase.
__label__2 Very Good: I saw this in the movie theather. It rocked then and it still rocks. The story line is superb. The charactors are well written. The violence might scare some young ones. After I saw this movie I never stopped talking aobut it. I highly recommend it!
__label__2 A blast from the past!: Unlike many things I used to like and am rediscovering to find I dont like as much, Transformers has only gotten better with age! Man, its like the best of western animation and japanese in an incredible amalgamation! if you've never seen the Transofrmers, don't be influenced by their bastardized offspring, beast wars, this cartoon was and is great!
__label__1 disappointed by this board game: I bought this game because it promised a "green" experience for the entire family. i must say, i was highly disappointed. is it called "green" because you are dealing with vegetables? So be it. My family could not find any interest in this game, not even my four year old whom we bought the game for. I did not find the added value of this game. don't waist your money on this.
__label__2 BEST MUTI VITAMINS IN THE MARKET: For Years i been taking it yes your urine may turn yellow i have orange label and sometimes if you eat it with food your stomach might hurt but its life its a good vitamins A C E D The best! I Rec People To Try This Vitamin
__label__1 Evolution is true: Science in no way refutes evolution, if used correctly. The authors of this book don't have an inkling of what 'science' is. If you're thinking about buying this book, do yourself a favor and go buy "On the Origin of Species" by Charles Darwin. That is, if you care about the truth. This book is full of lies. What it preaches is blatantly wrong and you would be a fool to believe a word of it.
__label__2 one of the most beautiful songs: this song is about lyrics, lyrics, lyrics. and leigh nash's beautiful vocals.i loved the bounce movie, but this song is more beautiful. actually, its one of our "songs" for my boyfriend and I. i think it should have recieved radio play, but i don't think it did. my favorite version of this song is the movie mix, which is more like and extended version. the only song i did not like is walking with strangers which is not sung by leigh nash. i just did not connect with it at all.need to be next to you is a good song for all you hopeless romantic types. the music video is really cool, it has images from the movie, which enhances what i just said about being a hopless romantic.. so with that being said i give 4 out of 5
__label__1 this movie is available on iTunes!!!: it's less than 20 bucks....so don't go spending anymore than that in this wonderful economy we have!!Cheers..Tony(NYC)
__label__2 Clear, Concise - What All Programming Books Should Be!: Those wishing to shift into the .NET phase will thoroughly enjoy Petzold's Key of C#. Not only does it teach the fundamentals clearly, it builds off the fundamentals with a clever approach to programming. Programming in the Key of C# promotes experimentation and critical thinking.
__label__1 I have such a Tooth-Ache: This movie had such a sugar sweet quality about it, I got a tooth-ache. I am surprised they didn't go back and save Political leaders and the like. Enjoyable most of the time if you can get past the obvious lack of rational thought, and wasted screen time. I should have rented it on video. Not a suitable movie to sit through at the theatre. TOO LONG. Rent it, make popcorn, take a break every 20-30 minutes, you're good to go.
__label__1 Unsatisfactory: I waited almost two months to rent this video. Unfortunately., I was disappointed. The movie while poignant, was spasmodic and disjointed. I had to try too hard to piece together the events while they were occurring. James Caviezel's performance was compelling. Dennis Quaid's acting was fair.
__label__2 a thriller of what if times meet.: very creative and well-made thriller.it is surprising viewers.when u leave cinema(or closes dvd/video/vcd)u are thinking it is worth paying 2 $(or renting or buying).for third dimension flick-buffs.
__label__2 Intelligent and heart-wringing: This is one of the few satisfying movies I can remember seeing. Apart from loving Dennis Quaid, who puts in a great performance, I like this film for its unabashed good storytelling. It is tense because it allows us to grow incredibly involved with the characters. Moreover, apart from the usual coincidence thing, the science fiction plot doesn't have holes. May you enjoy this movie as much as I did!
__label__2 Illogical But Wonderful: Even if you accept the basic premise of this movie, a re-connection between long dead fireman father and still grieving policeman son via ham radio, you will find something profoundly illogical in some of the individual scenes. That doesn't prevent it from being extremely moving thanks to beautiful flat-out emotional performances by Dennis Quaid, Jim Caviezel and flawlessly cast supporting actors. Look for an extraordinarily moving fire rescue scene. Some of the suspense set pieces worked into the story are superb.This film definitely overcomes its narrative flaws.Walmer Road in Toronto puts in a fine appearance as a street in Queens, N.Y.
__label__2 Fun Science Fiction: This movie is a feel good, science fiction movie with a murder mystery and plenty of action woven into it.
__label__1 FRequency: Very strange to follow. Too much forward and backwards in the plot. Like the suspense, probably won't watch again.Too shifty.
__label__2 A great character!: Catspaw was my introduction to Cat. Like other reviewers, I expected a bit of lite fluff to while away a boring afternoon, and got Paydirt with a capital 'P'. Vinge's creation, whom she called in an interview the embodiment of her sense of outrage at social injustice, is on my personal list of favorite literary characters of all-time. Read the book and find out why.
__label__2 Enjoyable book: I am a country music fan and have seen the movie many times. I wanted to read the book and I'm glad I did. It was enjoyable.
__label__2 excellant: this bok was recommed to me by my daughterinlaw,it was warm and funny and so true of Loretta Lynn,full of truth and surprises
__label__1 The Soviet view of the Cold War: Tass is Authorized to Announce is the Soviet version of any spy thriller you have ever read (or seen on the big screen) - but with the KGB as the good guys, attempting to foil the sinster plots of the CIA. However, Semenov lacks the semantics of say, a Tom Clancy. The plot is razor thin, the anti-semitism is revolting, and the the resolution of the conflict is laughable.While the book is certainly dated, (Cold War intrigue in Africa is so passe), it is an entertaining read if only to see how the USSR understood detente and cold war politics. Other than that, the book is tripe - not recommended.
__label__2 Solitary Witch: I bought this book a few years ago. It's always a range between love it and hate it when it comes to her work. For this one, I just like it. There is some information that I take and refer back to (elements, Witches' Pyramid, etc), but I know that there's more to my Path. I wouldn't say that she's "Fluffy" only because she puts witchcraft in terms so teenagers can understand it. There are things that I don't agree with, but all-in-all it's a good reference.)O(
__label__2 LOVE: Love. Love. LOVE this book! It has basically everything. Like a wiccan/ pagan dictionary. Of course You wouldnt read it from cover to cover. You could. But i wouldnt suggest it. But thats good! it means theres tons upon tons of info! It's great!
__label__2 Our favorite game, by far.: Cooperative games help keep the peace at our house and this is the one we play the most. We have so much fun working together to try to beat the robber--no tears at the end of this game!
__label__1 If you buy this, you're buying s**t. Literally.: I love Marilyn Manson!But... after watching this movie, I had a change of thoughts. If you like to see band members vomiting, band members deficating, and then playing with it, people rubbing stuff against their bare naked d*ck, and other profanity, you should buy this movie. I thought it would just be a movie of their tour, but it's a bunch of s**t. Stick to the CD's. By the way, I think Courtney put a hell of a show on at the tour! Manson... a bit sick. I still think that Manson kicks, but some of the stuff he does just disgustes me so much, and makes me think just what he's puting in the minds of our youth today. You think about it. The shootings at that school for instance...
__label__1 Tank top: I am very unimpressed by this product. Sizing is very small and the product it flimzy and poorly made. After 2 washings it had shrunk to the point where I just threw it away. I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone.
__label__1 Worthless: Doesn't fit the average 10" subwoofer. Edge of grills sits on surround, doesn't even reach subwoofer basket. Don't waste your money.
__label__1 You call this Tai Chi???: I would give this one 0 star if Amazon allowed me.I read all the good reviews on this DVD and decided to get a copy. Luckly we had one from the local library.After I reviewed the library copy, I am completely shocked that someone can produce a DVD like this one and call it "Tai Chi". It is not even half way close.The demonstrator didn't even get his movement right. In fact the content of the DVD is a set of morning exercise combining a little bit of everything possibly Asian: primary school morning exercise, some basic Yoga breathing and postures, some partial Tai Chi gesture. Coming from an Asian background, I almost felt this is an insult.If you are serious about learning Tai Chi, don't get misled by this DVD.
__label__1 Video Quality is VERY POOR - i think they copied the copy of a copy of a copy...: I like the video but it jumps ahead. For the 20 minute workout, i'm done in 15! The 60 minute program is more like 40.i think of all of the tutorials, i have seen only 1 all the way through and most, it just skips over them. It is horrible! I tried this but the video is such poor quality that it makes it difficult to feel it is doing any good.
__label__1 Morey is ignorant of the literature: This book deals in stereotypes and caricatures. It ignores the example of Jesus Christ, and denies the exile status of God's predestined elect people. It begs the question continually by assuming that the "responsible" thing to do is to kill the bad guys. As in his book on hell and the immortality of the soul, there is no evidence of Morey carefully reading the literature of those he attacks.For a page by page refutation of this book, I recommend Richard Barber's "Whenis it right to Fight? Never", available from Pilgrim Brethren Press, po box 171, Petersburg, Ohio 44454. Barber is a sovereign grace pacifist, like me.
__label__1 Shallow and Poorly Thought Out: The best thing about Morey's book is the Recommended Reading list at the end. Too bad he didn't study some of the books he listed. John Howard Yoder could have helped him tremendously. For the most part he omitted the most significant pacifists of the twentieth century. Yet he claims to offer a rebuttal to a position he doesn't remotely understand.This ill considered little book is filled with poorly examined assumptions. If you are looking for a thoughtful and biblically insightful defense of war , this is not it. But if you want a shallow piece of work that may reinforce your prejudice, When Is It Right To Fight? may be exactly what you have in mind.
__label__2 Lee plays the good guy!: This has to be one of the finest of the Hammer collection. Lee is piercing in his role as the Duc De Richelieu. There are occultists galore and it's up to Lee and his pal to save the son of a friend and his lover from the eternal grip of the creepiest villan Hammer studios ever unleashed. You must see this movie in widescreen! The visual created by director Terrence Fisher, of the English countryside, will give you a warm fuzzy until the final clash between good and evil.
__label__1 merlin: not that good. script for moviewhy do you need to add a specific amount of words? less can be better, especially in a review
__label__1 Did not speak to me, prefer "Peaceful Warrior" series: How to write a review about a book that does not speak to you? Difficult. While I liked "The Teachings of Don Juan: A Yaqui Way of Knowledge" (at least the first part) somehow "Journey to Ixtlan" did not speak to me at all. It came across as boring, meaningless walking and dialogues in desert without wisdom revealing to me.I certainly preferred the whole Dan Millman's "Peaceful Warrior" series with spiritual wisdom weaved into interesting adventures.
__label__2 The Court Jester: Danny Kaye was a gifted comic actor who not only touched and entertained millions of children, but at his best, brought out the child in all of us. A hilarious spoof on the swashbuckler picture, "The Court Jester" is widely regarded as his finest screen hour. With lots of color, action and excitement framing the immortal gags, this is family entertainment at its best .
__label__1 Worst film ever?: By film's end, I was hoping the Driller Killer would show up to put Telly and Capser out of their misery. In the end, the only people you truly feel sorry for, is the man on the subway with no legs and the skater punk who gets beaten nearly to death.
__label__1 Horrible: I am only 14 years old. I would think that a movie like this would have an impact on someone my age. It didnt. It nearly put me to sleep. It was the biggest waste of money in my life. I just bought it today and am throwing it away today also.All this movie offers is an inaccurate portrait or teens, and the story of a group of moron teenagers who thinks its cool to be going around drinking, smoking, engaging in brutal fights with people and other acts of vandalism, having sex with girls between the age of 12 and 15, and stealing from their parents.This was a huge waste of an hour and a half. I only gave this movie 1 star because amazon doesn't allow me to give it 0.If you are looking for a movie that offers the story of troubled teens, and is GOOD, Thirteen is the movie you wanna watch.
__label__1 Yuck, Yuck, Yuck: I hated this movie. SO unrealistic. Sure, maybe there are some little freaks running around raping and drinking and beating. But I AM a teenager in a city. NOBODY acts like this!What the hell is the point of this movie? To scare the crap out of parents?Also, the rape scene was vile. At first I respected the director for showing it and not shying away. A FULL MINUTE LATER, I started feeling awkward and uncomfortable. It wasn't even artistic, it was just disgusting and truly disturbing.
__label__2 This a real movie about real things.: This movie paints a picture of what goes on in the lives of kids all across the nation daily. This is a must see movie for many parents. Your kids may be faced with many of these decisions every day. It portrays some of the pressure for teens in a modern society. You need to see this movie and thoroughly understand it.
__label__2 Great movie?: This movie was pretty good, though there is a lot of sex, drugs, drinking, violence etc... I'm from NYC and some ppl i know are like that i think it shows what teen life is like for some ppl in NY. I loved how they used Washington Sq. Park-a lot of ppl that are like the charaters in the movie go to that park for the same reasons... skateboard, pick fights, do drugs etc.... This movie seemed so real and i hope there would be more movies like this. -14
__label__2 excellent movie: This movie depicts the real lives of teens grouwing up in nyc. I live in nyc and i have seen all of this going on. The only way to protect todays youth is to scare the hell out of them with movies like this.
__label__2 Real-life look into the life of teens: This is my all-time favorite movie. In some ways I can relate to this movie. I have friends who are just like these "KIDS". This movie takes a true look into a teens life. I recommend this movie to other teens and pre-teens.
__label__2 dream: I remember when I thought this film was controversial lol that is until I saw "Bully" Anyway this movie is about a boy who is obsessed with (...) girls and well all the kids lives are pretty much full of drugs and sex. Good ending, what goes around comes around.
__label__2 Not A KIDS Movie: Being a teen boy I wanted to see this movie for all the hot chicks. To my disappiontment there wasn't any. Just a bunch of guys having sex and walking around shirtless and showing us their rear ends. Justin Pierce "Casper", the blonde boy at the guys house that was shaking, and kid urinating near Casper are hot. We get to see all of them shirtless. If you get the Widescreen DVD on the far left you can see Justin's behind in a graphic rape/sex scene. RIP Justin I will miss you...you were so hot.
__label__2 Nice Debut: Saw these guys open for Butch Walker in Boston a couple months ago and they played a nice set. Since I liked what I heard I picked up the album. Good stuff, give it a listen.
__label__1 Pretty but not made well: They are not fitted. They are very puffy and baggy. Do not fit at all like they are suppose to.
__label__1 something u would'nt expect: this movie is terrible. charectors are weak and the plot just plains sucks on white bread. if anything, you should see 100 girls. I dont think this movie should have even been made.
__label__2 Our Father Abraham: Our Father Abraham: Jewish Roots of the Christian FaithA book every Christian should read. We cannot fully understand the teachings of Jesus and our Bible without a through knowledge of Jewish history and culture. We worship a Jewish savior, who worshiped in a synagogue, honored and practiced Jewish rituals. We read from a Jewish book, our Bible written by Jewish men. To fully understand the symbolism in the Bible we must know something about Jewish religeous practices.Christianity is a branch attached to a tree that has its roots in Judaism This book is one of the best available for a deeper understanding of Jewish culture and religeon. I highly reccomend this book to all Christains wishing to have a deeper understanding of their faith and its beginnings.
__label__1 Never got it, never heard from them: I never received this product and have not heard from the vendor except to ask for a review.
__label__1 BAD BACKSTREET BOYS: If you've ever seen a David DeCouteau movie (Brotherood, Leeches, Werewolves of New York) you know what to expect: a homoerotic mishmash of ridiculous plotting, hunky boys in skimpy underwear; and relentless padding consisting of slow motion swaggering and lots of pecs and abs. In RING OF DARKNESS, Adrienne Barbeau (Swamp Thing, Fog, Creepshow, Maude) plays the boy band's seductive manager who stages an audition to replace the band's lead singer who tried to leave them after he found out what the boys in the band were in reality. Barbeau does well as always, but the rest of the insanely attractive cast needs acting lessons badly. By the time you've figured out just what these hunks do to keep their looks, you've had to sit through some pretty derivative plotting and a predictably campy ending. DeCouteau needs to rethink his future projects and at least come up with more than just pretty bods.
__label__1 Wow bad even by DeCoteau standards: A real time waster. Not even decent underwear scenes for those who buy these things for that.
__label__1 It was very wordy and the worst book I have ever read: Seriously, this book is just convoluted and boring. I can't believe this is called a classic. Its terrible and the educators at certain high schools should not force this book upon kids--it lowers their grades and intelligence.
__label__2 Love it!: The download was quick. This story looks great on my kindle. I am so glad to have purchased this item!
__label__2 Never becomes passe!: I decided to read this book after watching it on PBS. Of course there was more detail in the actual novel and Jane Austen never fails to "dazzle you with her footwork". The description and narrative is beautiful and makes you feels as if you were actually there.
__label__1 Didn't like the paper quality and presentation: I bought them (all the Barnes & Noble Classics) to complete my Jane Austen's collection, and honestly, didn't like the paper quality, it seems like they didn't even care for the presentation of them; it didn't look elegant, cheap to be more specific.
__label__1 Tough going: Reading this novel was slow going. As a guy, I found the lack of action stultifying, and the flashes of humor were too quaint for me to derive any pleasure from them. The answer to the book's primary riddle--who shall Emma marry?--becomes obvious early on, and everything else is just a tedious pairing off until that riddle is expressly answered. There's a bit of local and historical color, but rarely does the narrative rise above the description of, say, a summer outing. Not one of Jane Austen's best.
__label__1 Just OK: The first 2 Jane Austen books I read were Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility. Both I considered excellent books, Pride and Prejudice being my favorite. I had high hopes of Emma, considering it had been made into the modern movie "Clueless". However, I have found this book very tiresome and it took me a long time to trudge my way through it. It may be the fact that I didn't like the main character as I had in the other books, but this book really went by slowly. It wasn't that bad of a story and really deserves 2 1/2 stars instead of the given 2 stars, but thats not an option. I would still recommend people to read the book for the good plot behind slow movement and seeing this prideful heroine transformed into a more likeable person.
__label__2 What's the fuss about Jane Austen?: I'm so sorry, but I simply fail to see what's so wonderful about Jane Austen. Her writing is adroit, and paints an intriguing picture of her times. She illustrates the psychology of a historic culture, but....I just don't find her all that wonderful. I realize I'll be stoned by all the Jane Austen fans out there, but THERE IT IS.
__label__1 Help us all: I am quite confused on how people could like this book. For one it takes forever to get to the point. Plus how could we possibly like Emma. She is so self centered and ignorant. The only two times in which she can somewhat appeal to us is when she crys and in comparison to Mrs. Elton. This is a mockery of upper class life of the 19th century and Jane Austen, to my knowledge, lived a somewhat isolated life. How could she write a book on a topic which she doesn't know about. This further mocks the upper class leaving the point of this book as being entertainment. Why put us through 500 pages of pain. I think Jane Austen was right when she said " no one but myself will much like [Emma]."
__label__2 Great Book!: This may very well be my second favorite Jane Austen book. The plot is ingenious, and the characters are hilarious. Dover does a good job of publishing, and this book is no exception. I highly recommend Emma!
__label__1 I Hate Emma: I do like 19th Century fiction. I do like Pride and Predjudice. I know lots of people don't like saying Classics are uninteresting. Apparantly Jane Austen said after writing this book that she had wanted to create a character that no-one would like but herself. I am the only person I know who hates Emma. I agree that the book is well written but I just don't like Emma. Sorry if you do.
__label__1 Doesn't survive the test of time: I endured through the entire audiobook because I finish what I start but this book had very little interest for me. First I think it's a chick book, one that women would find more interesting, second it's about a spoiled brat that thinks herself the world, with which most readers will not sympathize. Maybe the book was great in the time when it was published, but the style does not suit me for these reasons. The setting was not interesting for me: 18th century England in the countryside where nothing happens, where propriety is more important that authenticity and passion. The climax of the novel, like the contemporary English culture, is all too subtle for my taste and like the rest of the book lacks the drama that I expected from this supposed classic. In short I think other great books have lasted the test of time but this is certainly not one of them. It too easily loses your attention.
__label__2 Austen sparkles as always, but this is no Pride and Prej!: Personally, I love everything Jane Austen ever wrote to BITS. But none of her works (except maybe the humorously offbeat "Northanger Abbey") can match the high standards set by "Pride and Prejudice". There's the usual cast of comic characters, and some scenes really are a scream, but the heroine, Emma Woodhouse, and her 'consort' Frank Churchill are a bit too brattish for my liking. Their 'humour' (acidly bitchy spoilt brat gossip about the most kind-hearted and guileless members of the village) is just a little too vicious for me, and their appalling treatment of Jane Fairfax, and Harriet Smith, and the hilarious Miss Bates left me feeling a bit sick. Thank God Mr. Knightley's there to keep Emma in line. This is still a great novel, as witty and funny as "Pride and Prejudice"--but it's comedy with a bit of a nasty undertaste.
__label__1 Rubbish: What rubbish.Way too much violence. Why do kids movies have to be so violent these days? (or when it was made).Had a few laughs (I'm an ex-pat Australian) but not worth the plastic it was made from.Certainly not recommended for general viewing as the cover shows.
__label__2 Bernard and Miss Bianca Do It Again!: In Disney's "The Rescuers Down Under," Rescue Aid Society mice Bernard and Miss Bianca travel to Australia to help Mara Houte, the golden eagle. With the assistance of Wilbur, an albatross, and numerous other friends encountered along the way (such as a wise-cracking kangaroo rat), they hurry to help the endangered bird. Voice talents of Bob Newhart (Bernard), Eva Gabor (Miss Bianca) and John Candy (Wilbur) move the story along at a good pace. George C. Scott provides voice for the villain, a bounty hunter of endangered animals. Scott's sidekick is a goanna lizard called Joana - and there is some fascinating interplay between the lizard and the man. A sidebar plot is Bernard's plan to propose marriage to Miss Bianca ... and all of the things that conspire to get in the way. This is a nice movie for the entire family, and one with a good message. I highly recommend it.
__label__2 cave twins review from grandkids.: Or rather my Granddaughters love it. Recommended to them by Grandma who has fond memories of reading it when she was their age. The feedback from Heidi ( to whom it was sent ) was " Wow Wicked Brilliant !"
__label__1 Incorrect information in this book: I don't recommend this book due to many incorrect observations and information noted in the chapters. I was very surprised that this book was recommended by other readers because there were many mistakes and errors in the book. Some important topics were discussed incorrectly and others were too brief. To find out and confirm this I gave this book to several local real estate contractors and they pointed out many other errors in this book that even I was unaware of. They explained to me how many things discussed in the book were outdated or not relevant.
__label__1 Negative review - too basic and not too helpful: The only time I would write a negative review if I think a book has been over rated. This book is definitely over rated. My husband and I are real estate investors and continually read books to improve our profits. We both felt this book was too basic and we did not get helpful information. We go to monthly meetings for investors in our county and this is one of the books on the "don't buy" list on our bulletin board!
__label__2 A "MUST READ" for all Home Inspectors!: This book is the premiere reference book for new Home Inspectors. The authors' knowledge is based on thousands of inspections. The layout and style of the book make it very easy to read and reference. There is a lifetime worth of valuable home inspection information at a very reasonable cost. MUST READ
__label__1 This book did not teach me anything I didn't already know: If you are looking for a book that will teach you a lot about real estate and home inspections then this is not the book for you. The chapter information and text content of this book was very basic and did not teach me anything I didn't already learn from other books that were much better. Inspecting homes is something I have done for many years and I would not recommend this book to any customers or contractors. If you know absolutely nothing about real estate then you might learn a few things but not too much.
__label__1 Garbage - Avoid: The dimensions indicate 1/4 inch which would be fine except it is apparently the FOLDED dimension. Give me a break!
__label__1 freely available: Since those responsible for this animated version of "Animal Farm" failed to renew their copyright (this came out in 1954), this film is now freely available, for example on YouTube, where it can be legally uploaded in its entirety.It follows the book much more than the recent version did, although still very loosely. The biggest difference is its completely different, more hopeful ending.
__label__2 The Best Bible Story Book We Own!: We own many Bible story books, but this one is my favorite. We read from this book every day, and the kids love it. It includes stories that are left out of many children's Bible story books. It is wonderful to read in order, and it really keeps the attention of the children. When it's time to shut the book, my kids say, "What's the story for tomorrow called, Mommy?", because they so look forward to reading this book.
__label__1 Skip this author!: I purchased this relatively unknown book due, in part, to the positive reviews. I was misled. As an avid reader, this book was underdeveloped and poorly written. The numerous typos are distracting and the characters lack depth. I forced myself to read the book, hoping it would improve but it did not. Save your money do not buy this book or anything by this author.
__label__2 I Love It!!: I love this book. I am almost done the series. It is an amazing book! There is a huge series coming after this book, three other series! I hope you like it! Rachael at age 11and1/2 :}
__label__2 The gateway to another world!: I started the book when I was seven or so, and I almost couldn't put it down at night! Each chapter has gripping detail, enough violence to satesfy a kid my age, and the charecter's actions and feelings were so real-like that I felt like I was right there, at a Gathering, right there, at the fight between ThunderClan and ShadowClan, right there, in the ThunderClan camp. I'm ten now, have read the whole first series twice and have started the second series, and I'd recomend this book to any kid who likes cats, excitment, adventure, and a litle pinch of violence now and then in their books. The begining of the story of Rusty, the so-called kittypet, who joins a clan of feral cats and saves the day in the end, who came from Firepaw to Fireheart, the ThunderClan warrior!
__label__2 i love this book: this is an amazing book with great action and is a pageturner with a great plot and lots of supense.
__label__2 Great book: Very enjoyable you can never stop because this book is filled with suspends and cold hangers this was a great book
__label__2 A great book!: I'm sorry to give you this late response because I read this book today. This was an excellent book! I would recommend everyone to read this book. This book inspired me about not giving up on your goal.
__label__2 ONE OF THE GREATEST BOOKS ON EARTH!!!!!: I recommend this book to any person on the face of the earth! This book is great for cat lovers,dog lovers,horse lovers,any kind of lover! After reading this I bought the rest of the series,and I know you'll love it too!! I SAY IT SHOULD BE AWARDED THE NEWBERY HONOR AWARD!!! Read this book to find how Rusty, a kittypet (a house cat) finds his destiny to become a great warrior!A #1 Fan,Kierstyn (Forestfur)
__label__2 Great!: Oh, this series is so good! I am waiting impatiently for the 6th one to come out, and so i am reading all the other ones over and over again. And I've just learned that there is to be a new series of Warriors. All new characters and clans! Stone clan, sky clan, and some other ones I forgot. it's called Midnight and is coming out next year on March. I'm going to pre-order mine's now!
__label__2 LOVE IT!!: Okay, first off I'll tell you that all the books in the series (there are four main series, then a couple "in-between" books) are GREAT! However, it gets to be too much. Remembering all the names, what Clan they come from, who their mate is, who there kits are, who their friends/enemies are, who their brothers and sisters are, it's too much!But, I'm not here to bag on the books, I read the first one because a bunch of my friends were going on and on about them, it's a couple weeks later, and I'm just finishing The Last Omen, sooo... I don't know if that says anything other than I LOVE WARRIORS!!!!
__label__2 AMAZING: As soon as I started reading this book I was hooked. Erin Hunter did a fabulous job capturing the readers intrest and keeping them interested. Even my brother (who hates cats) was compelled to read this novel.
__label__1 plotless: It is an undramatic visage of what should be a dramatic era of Margaret Thatcher. An example paragraph of the endless descriptions that mar the book (if i'm breaking copyrights laws, let me know):Nick wasn't sure how it started. Sam Zeman was laughing so much he lay back on the floor, but then choked and had to sit up. One of the girls pointed at him mockingly, but it wasn't mockery, she was laughing uncontrollably herself. Nat was red in the face, pinching the tears out of his eyes and pulling down the corners of his mouth to try to stop it. Nick could only stop giggling by glaring at the floor, and as soon as he looked up he was giggling again convulsively, it was like hiccups, it was hiccups, all mixed up together with the whooping, inexplicable funniness of the brandy bottle, the Renoir lady, the gilded plaster crown above the bed, all of them with their ideas and bow ties and plans and objections.
__label__1 Not worth it: After finally finishing this book, I am very surprised that it won a prize. The first several hundred pages have the main character (Nick Guest) doing little more than having sex, fantasizing about having sex with every other male character (major or minor), or wondering if anyone else can guess that he's fantasizing about sex.Perhaps it would be a better read for someone British, because I found it hard to appreciate the depiction of life in the British aristocracy. The character development felt very heavy-handed and repetitive, as one scene after another depicted Nick feeling embarrassed or trying to figure out how to handle a social situation.The end of the book was much more rewarding, as the web of characters unravelled and their pretensions were stripped away. I also enjoyed some clever Henry James references. Still, I don't think the investment it takes to slog through the beginning is worth it overall.
__label__2 My Comfort Book: This book helped me raise three little boys born in two and a half years. From Diapers to trucks and fighting, I found what I needed to know in these pages. I am now sending copies to my three neices who have just had boys of their own. Truly trans-generational!
__label__1 Confusing even if you are not an idiot: This book is poorly organized and confusing. The authors used way too many quotations from other sources, i.e. books, websites. In the end, I have to wonder what the authors' own take is on the subject. It doesn't have a backbone of its own, period.
__label__1 Awful movie.: Amazing, but the name is the most redeeming quality of this movie. The "chain gang" is comprised of MEN, and only men. Men escape from a chain gang with a little help from two women. Acting is okay to bad, quality is okay to bad, story is okay to bad.
__label__2 social scientists, take your medecine!: Sowell is a true intellectual. He is not afraid to go where his mind takes him. In this work he takes on his common peeve: social engineering. For Sowell nothing is worse than utopian minded do-gooders armed with inadequate knowledge of the subjects they pontificate on. To be frank, I think Sowell's arguments are sometimes thin (much social engineering is done well and is necessary), but it is always good to read someone who will challenge convention, especially when that person is as bright as Sowell is.
__label__2 Sowell is the soul of our time: This book has only gained by the passage of time since it was written. It is clear that his analysis of the huge separation between those who view man as "constrained" vs the modern Liberal viewpoint has only grown deeper. He actually makes the best case I have read for the Liberal position, and it is still sorely lacking. I am so grateful that he lives and writes.
__label__2 Very stable: Excellent quality. Very stable . I ride indoors twice a week for a hour. This device is perfect for keeping my bike steady.
__label__2 a must have: This climbing block is excellent stablizer for frontwheel and gives it a balance. It also maintains height of front wheel. I never " stacked " more than one because I never ordered more because of expence. I did not use it for climbing, nor I had any difficulty climbing my bike. I suggest buying it with your cycleops unit.
__label__1 they are posers: i bet you 10$ that they stole destination unkown from the lyrics of ruby soho by rancid kicks there gay poopy areses there stupid punk wannabes like blink182 listen to us bombs or rancid or operation ivy or the vandals or the dropkick murphys or the clash or sublime or the casaulties
__label__2 This is a great CD: This one of my favorite albums. If you like Green Day or Blink, or just wnat to listen to some awsome pop/punk music, I suggest that you go out and by this album. I also suggest that you go out and see MEST aoon. I've seen them twice and they put on a kick-butt... show.
__label__2 Mest above all: Mest is the greatest band of all time, I highly recommend that you go out and buy the Waisting Time CD, you will not be disappointed...
__label__2 Destination Unknown: Destination Unknown by Mest, is such a great CD, their songs are songs that people can relate to, and the catchyness of the songs will stick in your head. This Cd is by far the best cd i've heard yet.
__label__2 Mest is WICKED: Mest takes every genre and mixes it together. They have the pop punk edge, of course, over thuggish R&B;/Rap beats, and they have some raggae and ballads mixed in there as well. This is teenage angst, with the humor of the Beastie Boys, and the angst of Good Charlotte.They're really eclectic, and not too hard on the eyes either. :)
__label__2 I love this CD: I love Mest....I've seen them in concert, and they're awesome. Tony is great. This is the 3rd CD and I think it's pretty kickass. Sure, some of the songs aren't so lyrically great, but it's fun to listen to. The songs that stand out are "Drawing Board" (who doesn't like this song?) "Cadillac" (for you people with some ghetto in you) and "Yesterday" (vocals by Jeremiah, sounds awesome).Some of the weirder songs are "Reason" and the hidden track. They're both cool, just...too jamacian. Oh well, I still listen to them.If you want a nice variety in music and fun music to listen to whenever, get this CD.Whether they're punk, pop-punk, or pop-rock, they're good.
__label__2 Kick Ass Pop Punk...: Catchy lyrics, sick riffs, and a band with a totally cool attitude, this, in my opinion, is their best to date, with their self titled in second and mo money mo 40'z in third. The only album from Mest that i didnt really like was wasting time, but it still wasn't that bad...
__label__2 Kick [behind] BAND!!!!: Mest is the Best!!!! I just got there cd and i fell in love with it the first time i listened to it. This is a cd every music fan must get. the songs r kick [behind] and so r the guys. if u don't go out and buy this cd i'm going to MEST you up!!!!
__label__2 Third and other streams: Well, since other jazz-fans (mr. Dennis, mr. Chell, mr. Lampereta...) have already given quite elaborate and diverse arguments in favor of this intriguing album (plus some sophisticated counterarguments as well), I will only add a small voice in their favor and another five stars to match it...Cool and third-streamish jazz is not really my thing, but this is such a great collection of diverse, beautifully performed and arranged music that I'm left really impressed. Naturally, Lovano shines through like a real jazz-giant he obviously is.
__label__1 Junk -- will flood your kitchen: Expensive and works for less than 3 years, at which time it will flood your kitchen. I've had two dispensers and both flooded the kitchen. How this product stays on the market is beyond me.
__label__2 This is my second time purchasing this item: I had an earlier model of this hot water dispenser for eleven years. That one had a metal container which rusted out. This newer version has a molded plastic type of water container which is definitely an improvement. I love the addition of the temperature control which the old one did not have.
__label__2 *THE* XML book for .NET: Dino Esposito has total, absolute command of the subject matter that he expertly teaches in this book. This is a template for how all technical training books should be written. I wanted in-depth coverage of the XML object library in .NET and that is exactly what this book delivers. This is THE book on XML in .NET. Don't waste your money on anything else.It is also terrific supplemental material for the Developing XML Web Services and Server Components certification exam. I recommend Mike Gunderloy's book as an all-encompassing source (look up my review for that book); however, I recommend reading the first four chapters of this book before you start Gunderloy's book if you don't have much experience reading and writing XML in .NET. Chapters 12 and 13 on remoting and web services, respectively, are also great sources of exam prep material. In fact, Chapter 12 on .NET Remoting is the best chapter on the subject you will find anywhere.Terry, MCAD and MCSD for Microsoft .NET
__label__1 Hoping, But NO: Was hoping other reviews were off, but unfortunately they were right. Not even close to a recommended movie. Or as would be said by submariners, a true "Five finger gagger".
__label__1 90 minutes gone from my life: As we used to say in the submarine service . . . you get a double punch on your Hurter Card for sitting through this. How did they get Dennis Hopper to sign on for this one? It looks like it was filmed with a camcorder. During the semi-nude scenes I found myself looking for holes in their underwear. I'll give it 2 stars since it was in color and had sound.
__label__2 Accurate: I bought this to help me when I started school to get my degree in political science and it proved to behelpful along with another book I bought for the same reason. I use them to decipher anything I am not clear on. Drink water when using this book because it's good for you,
__label__2 Mountain of contemplation: great book for those interested in orthodox spirituality. for more look for "the way of the pilgrim"
__label__2 Excellent for everybody: My 8 months baby loves it!!!, he may not fully understand what's all about but you can run it a couple of times a day and he sits there still to watch, recomended for everyone
__label__2 sesame street: Kids get to give an opinion of their favorite song and why. Encourages all children to have a voice. The songs and movement gets kids up and moving. My three month old granddaughter wiggles and kicks with the tunes, when she gets toddling she'll being dancing to it. The music, flashy colors and movement will keep any child entertained no matter what their age.
__label__2 Great historical novel: This is a highly recommended book for anyone who is interested in the history of the Jewish Lower East Side in the late 19th century and early 20th century. It is written by an author with intimate knowledge of the time and place. Written in 1917, it is a very captivating and compelling story of an Eastern European Jewish immigrant's plight on The Lower East Side. I highly recommend it.
__label__1 Singular work of genius arrives in fish wrap: The greatest achievement in western literature is now available in a bound version heretofore reserved for second rate "How to" books from the remainder bin. This publisher offers no preface, foreword, notes, or so much as an illustrator's credit for the apt cover; the sole redeeming feature of this tawdry effort. Usually clocking in at 740 pages plus, this version manages to squeeze every word of the masterwork into a nimble 554 pages, thanks to a total lack of margin space or chapter breaks. Laughably, the book's spine does not allow even for this squeezed assembly, so that it arrives splayed and bow-legged, in unintentional tribute to the willowy author perhaps. Under-inked to the point of appearing mimeographed, with serifs giving way on almost every page, this is hardly the version one needs of a book to be cherished and re-visited often.
__label__1 Duplicates others: Typical straight-from-Project-Gutenberg textfile conversion: no ToC, no italics, no chapter breaks. See comparative review here:Ulysses
__label__2 A Masterpiece of English Literature: After finally summoning the courage to attempt a reading of Ulysses, I am profoundly greatful that I did. While the novel is intricately layered and multi-referenced, reading it is really not as challenging as its reputation would have one believe. Moreover, it is a page-turner in the truest sense; never before have I been so absorbed by a piece of literature. Joyce's relentless and masterful descriptions of characters' thoughts, both important inner monologues and equally flippant patter, offer an insight into the human condition which is unparalled in English literature. I am utterly convinced that Ulysses is the most important novel of the twentieth century; it is a true masterpiece of literary art, one that simply makes the reader proud to be human.
__label__2 i love it: I am very satisfied and I like it, i think....the shipping cost is a little expensive for me...( because i do not live in USA^^)anyway ..thank you & Mary Christmas!!!
__label__1 Habent sua fata libelli: That book has a luck. It's the worst book which has ever been written. Strangely, there are some people who think it is the best one. that's what the latin phrase (above) means
__label__1 Ulysses: This book is a struggle. I don't know where it's going and can't decide if I want to be there at the finnish.
__label__1 Not for me.: This being my first time reading Joyce, I didn't really know what to expect. After reading for a day or two, I found that it was too scattered and hard to follow. I don't think it would be right for me to say that I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, because I think it is worth a try. I might come back to it in a few years, but right now it just isn't exactly my cup of tea.
__label__1 Italics are capitalized: Substituting capitalization for italics is unacceptable. Also, multiline verses are collapsed into one unbroken line.
__label__1 Dirty and cheap: Can you make a cheaper case that these chips come in? The case weighs about 1 oz and is ready to fall apart. The fake felt they use disintegrates at touch leaving the chips dirty--covered in some sort of micro-fiber recycled paper dirt. The chips themselves are OK, without a reliable way to transport them this poker set isn't worth much. Of course its made in China and you get what you pay for.
__label__1 not what it describe. when i actually had found out the chip is different when i had open the chip n making sure..: i'm not happy what i have order from here. Literally chip are color out ...seem like they been used. Dice are yellow even they are said to be ''new''. i had open the chips and feel there weight and they don't feel like 11.5 feel like they put a metal in between and let it be. Terrible...cards cheap plastic card. I will never by product from them again. Description is different then what i receive that all i got to say i got the picture to show it. false advertisement given out cheap piece of crap...look GROSSS
__label__2 High quality, casino-grade poker chip set: Casino-quality chip set. Heavy-duty case. Set is very heavy -- accounts for the high shipping charge.
__label__1 Poor Quality: The quality of the case is poor. It does not close well. And there seems to be poor structural integrity of the case. Some of the chips are dirty or damaged somehow?
__label__1 These Shows Have All Been Edited: All shows on this set are the edited versions. Each show is missing more than 3 minutes of footage. The other set from this company is the same. If you want the original un-cut versions then skip these. If you don't mind having missing footage, then go for it. Personally, I would rather" NOT " have something than have shows the way these are.
__label__2 Sherman Foundations and Interval Spin: I rode the Foundations course and found that I was within my target heart rate for 24 minutes total. Instructor gives encouragement and tips for staying focused on the ride. If you turn off the lights and spin, its almost the same as being in a live class.
__label__1 There are better flash cartooning books out there!: In my opinion the only chapters worth reading are chapters 12, 13, 14 and 15. My biggest complaint about this book is that most of the chapters were boring. Chapter 2 shows an ostrich walk cycle, chapter 6 shows fighting skunks and chapter 8 shows a talking grave. I prefer "Flash 5 Cartooning" and "Flash Cartoon Animation: Learn From The Pros" over this book.
__label__1 Is book true?: In the very first chapter the motion picture frame of war coverage on the Roer river in Germany, it shows the dates 1942-1943, but the invasion of Europe never happend until June 1944. Please explain.
__label__2 Not Just Brokaw: I was terrifically moved by this recording, and Tom Brokaw was the least of it. The supporting cast really throws themselves into the letters from The Greatest Generation. Nothing is hokey or excessive, but the honest human sentiment is tough to resist.By contrast, Tom Brokaw sounds like he's phoning in his part of the script. But he has comparatively little to do here. The heavy lifting is done by the professional narrator and actors. A stunner. It's impossible to recommend this edition too highly.
__label__1 Don't be fooled by the preview: I saw the preview for this movie and thought it'd bepretty funny. The Napolean Dynamite scene is one of thehighlights,and that occurs in the first scene. Unfortunately,it's all downhill from there. A big chunk of the movie isparodies of Meet the Parents and Meet the Fockers. Tryingto parody a classic comedy is like going to karaoke night andtrying to sing a Celine Dion song. At best, it's tolerable.Worst case scenerio, well.... you get the idea. Nowhere nearas funny as the Scary Movie movies.
__label__1 Unrated?: I'm tired of all these movies claiming to be the Unrated Version and not offering a single thing that wouldn't be included without exception in a PG-13 movie. Add to that only seven or eight decent laughs in the whole movie and I'm pretty ticked-off. Explaining the spoofs would actually be funnier than the movie, so I won't do it.Tried and true spoof formula is not properly hashed out in cheap attempt to cash-in on quarter-of-a-century craze(Airplane 1980). Top Secret, Hot Shot, Hot Shot Part Deux and Not Another Teen Movie are much examples of this (art) form.Might have given it two stars if they left the Unrated off the box.A lot more of Josh Meyers might have helped.
__label__1 A very, very bad movie: I recently witnessed this car crash of a movie. I usually like parodys but this movie was boring and unfunny.
__label__1 One of the worst out there.: Date Movie is from two of the six writers of Scary Movie, apparently they chose the two worst because the movie fails to generate laughter. A few chuckles here and there but that's all.Date Movie is a spoof of romantic comedies. Simply that idea sounds good right? The writers had alot to work with, but they failed miserably. Alyson Hannigan plays the main character, Julia Jones. Personally, not a big fan of her comedy. Now, Eddie Griffin, Jennifer Coolidge and Fred Willard can be quite hilarious but none of that is portrayed in this flop.This might be enjoyed by some, but only a few. For me, a big comedy fan, it was pretty bad in general.I actually watched it at the theaters and, my friends, it was the biggest waste of ten dollars in my life! It is now out on dvd and someone will have to pay me to watch it again...Ok maybe not pay me but at least pay for the movie.One measly star *
__label__1 Torture to watch: I went to see this but it was not by choice. I went on a "field trip" with my co-workers and this was the movie that won the vote.I am all for parodies (like "Saturday Night Live") but this movie went overboard. So does all the Scary Movies (I don't like these either). Do yourself a favor and skip this movie. Get yourself a real "Date Movie".
__label__1 always laugh at these parody movies...but not this one...: The movie was funny the first, oh lets say about maybe the first 20-40 minutes. After that the movie is garbage. The humor and mocking was so dis-tasteful and a little offensive. The cat in the bathroom, "dead mrs.jones", the little jokes by the bachellor's parents, the bizarre family relationships, and the mock-sexual references to sex.I was very surprised at myself when i viewed the film. I hardly laughed and didnt laugh when I needed. Like I said I totally love these not another teen movie, scary movie type films...but Date Movie is pure garage. The humor is so awful and the mockery sucks tooBottom line: Horrible movie...never watching it again.
__label__1 Dated and Dull: This is waaay before the age of personal trainers. Not only is their a small amount of bare skin, but the bare skin they show ain't worth seein'. This stuff got better in the 80s, when there was ample supply of attractive, and less inhibited women.
__label__1 Worst movie in history: Where to start? This thing is so bad that it is a disgrace to bad melodrama. The plot is so predictable it is sickening. This movie wasn't even released until after Harry Potter was released.
__label__2 great: These are authentic Ray-Ban aviator glasses and they look amazing on an average person's face even though they say they are large. the only thing i don't like it that the lens aren't a non-see through green, depending on the lighting, people can see your eyes, this happens about % of the time. outside of that they are amazing glasses and look great.
__label__2 Tony B -- New Chairman of the Board: If Sinatra was considered the Chairman of the Board, Tony Babino will be considered President and CEO of the company. From the opening chord of this CD, you'll be very, very impressed with Tony B's powerhouse vocals. He belts out the standard, "I've Got The World On A String" with a livelier arrangement, to a heartfelt rendition of "And I Love Her". If you think he might be another cover artist, you'll be wrong. Tony B writes his own songs as well. He wrote 4 of the 14 tracks on this CD. Some of his own compositions like "50 Years" and "Sentimental Heartstrings" are better than some standards. This is a superb CD. You'll definitely, without a doubt, enjoy this CD. As the title suggests...you'll be "Swingin' Around with Tony B." for a long time to come.
__label__2 Fun Family Film!: I love Cary Grant and Sophia Loren in this fun movie. The kids have an adventure living in a houseboat as opposed to living in an apartment in D.C.
__label__2 Houseboat: This movie is a real delight. It is better than I remembered it as a child (my priorities were different). This plays out as a predictable romantic comedy but great fun anyway. No heavy plot here. As Grants housekeeper, Loren helps Grant to change his priorities, be less of a jerk, and bond with his children. This takes place on a leaky houseboat that sometimes breaks loose and floats down river. Grants dry humor and wit is great fun to watch. Loren is the Italian beauty (thought she was ugly when I was a child)that falls in love with Grant and brings the family together.
__label__2 a very meaningful and entertaining movie: Saw the bachelor in the cinema,It did not fail to keep me smiling and laughing through the whole show.it show that money really can't get you true love.It is a guy sincerelyty that had touch the girl's heart.And at the last part of the movie when one whole bunch of brides chasing after the guy in the movie ,boy it was a real fancinating moment I ever seen,never had I seen such phenomenon ever.After all this is really a good movie to keep you entertain for two hours.worth watching.
__label__1 Not much redeeming value: I don't mind implausible stories, but only if the film makers can pull it off. I was sad to discover that Chris O'Donnell can't act. I hadn't noticed before because he was well cast in a few other roles, but fortunately never had to carry a story. Part of the problem might go to the director. In fact the director is highly suspect. The timing was off and there is no evidence that the man in charge had any clear view of what he wanted to bring out in the characters or storyline. I was sorry I spent the money on the rental. Don't bother.
__label__1 Difficult Viewing: This film is difficult to watch for many reasons. It is below average both artistically and technically. The film is a classic of its genre but for me HUSBANDS and WOMAN UNDER THE INFLUENCE are much better as films. [Note how the excessive laughter in FACES is annoying and unrealistic whilst in HUSBANDS it is natural and enjoyable.]
__label__2 Old protest music by an old hippy. Definitely not country music.: This is a compilation of songs published on other records. It is still good. Writing a protest song was and is just Country Joe McDonald’s way of saying hello. If you are interested in the 60s or the Vietnam War this is worth considering. The most known song on this album, The Fixing to Die Rag, is less raucous than the Woodstock version of that song and still a good version, with the advantage that I can play this one for the grand kiddies without their grandmother going ballistic. For a long time this album was only available at great cost but now it has been republished at a reasonable price and is worth considering.
__label__1 Sorry I bought it.: Less than three months after purchase, it's in the shop; an authorized repair center. Picture started "snapping" 'till no more picture. They replaced the picture tube and something else. I took it home. Then, it started displaying flickering white lights across the top of the screen and a vertical rectangular discoloration on the left side of the screen. They've been working on it for a week ...
__label__1 Refund: This has to be one of the worst movies I have seen. What a waste of talent & money. One has to wonder what someone was thinking when this was made. I could only stand to watch half of it.. Don't waste your time & money.
__label__1 Hard to follow: My husband and I watched this over the weekend. We were both very lost for about the first 25 minutes. Finally we watched the trailer to see if it was worth watching the rest of it. Watching the trailer helped - but not completely.This is by far - NOT our favorite movie of all time.
__label__2 Coconutheads: I've followed The Coconutheads since the early nineties as they've performed throughout south Florida. Their live performance would make a great album too! Val and Greg have a have an almost telepathic connection on stage... their saxophonist (Nicky, I think) is outrageous, mixing in jazzy, moody tones with great skill. The band has had some personnel changes, but the core members have stayed intact, although I miss the live drummer.
__label__2 great product: it's the best lube i've used so far, just a bit expensive and that's the only thing wrong with it
__label__2 Good Product - Stains can be dealt with: I also found this to be a good product and also originally found it to stain any fabric it came in contact with. However, when I contacted Pjur Customer Service, they suggested I try OxiClean or a similar formulation. That did in fact get out the stains.
__label__1 It is greasy: I bought this because of the men's health endorsement. My wife and I used it a few times and then desisted. It's ok for intercourse but not other activities.
__label__1 There are better lubes by FAR!: We did not like this lube. It was not slick enough for our purposes and was very watery. There are much better lubes out there for the money. It also stung per my wife, so we will not try this again.
__label__2 Love it!: i LOVED this movie! i watched it in my English class and LOVED it! it was soo beautiful and i had to buy it because it was so awesome. you never get bored, it has stuff for everyone in it. whether you like Romance, Action, Humor...it is all in there! i really enjoyed it =]
__label__2 The definitive Romeo & Juliet!: Italian director Franco Zeffirelli did an outstanding job of bringing Shakespeare's romantic tale to life. It is THE definitive version of Romeo & Juliet, in my opinion. The fact that the actors were so close to the age of the star crossed lovers adds realism and freshness to the story.Shakespeare's words flow so naturally that you forget that it is a classic play and just get lost in the story. The cinematography is beautifully done and the wonderful customes are a treat for the eyes!You will enjoy this movie ... again, and again ... I highly recommend it!
__label__2 Romeo & Juliet: Love at First Sight: Sure I only watched this because it was assigned for English, but I ended up liking it. Most other 15 year-olds don't like Shakespeare, but this is really good! I liked that they had the orignal Shakespearian language. I haven't seen the newer version of Romeo & Juliet, so I can't compare the two. I really recommend this movie to anyone. I sure would watch it again, even if it wasn't mandatory! It's an instant classic, and a must have for anyone. You wil love this movie. My parents love it too, it brings back a lot of memories for them (yes, good ones). All age groups would like this, except maybe ones younger than my age group (mid-teens). You won't regret getting (or at least renting it) so come on people, give this a try! Enjoy!!!!!
__label__1 Romeo & Juliet: The only reason I watched this movie is because it was a required see from a class in college I was enrolled in.
__label__2 the fight over music: Holloway's book is a wonderful introduction to what the history of western political philosophy says about the role of music in shaping people's character. The belief that music has a role in forming the character has always been a controversal stance, starting with Plato, and remains one still today. One only has to be reminded of Allan Bloom's chapter on Rock music and the reaction that section provoked shows how powerful this theme remains today. Liberals (ancient and modern, capitalist or not) don't like the idea that music plays a role in character formation.. and what Holloway's book does shows the reader what the big stars of western philosophy has to say on this subject. Holloways argues by ignoring the power of music in the formation of character of the young especially, contemporary society and the music it has bread.. has lead to extremes both in music and people's character.. and both for the worse.
__label__1 But They're Not On an Airplane!: I was extremely disappointed with Airplane II: The Sequel. The first one was great, and I'd watch it over and over again. But since I've seen the sequel, it hasn't been as funny. The sequel's pretty unoriginal and the replayed humor detracts from its predessor it's the same love story, and a smattering of redone scenes. (Rember the old woman who hung herself?) I wouldn't buy this one. In fact, I wouldn't even spend the money to rent it on DVD; save yourself a few bucks, rent it on VHS.
__label__1 More Groans Than Laughs: Weak, derivative, and thoroughly unfunny - classic example of a studio cashing in with the old Good Movie Rehash. (...). Although what's funny and what isn't is often a matter of opinion, the element of surprise is what defines humor. We laugh when the unexpected happens. But having seen it all before in the original, nothing - and I mean NOTHING - is funny in Airplane 2. Even the new jokes are variations on a theme. Save your money and watch Airplane! twice.
__label__1 Strictly for Seattle radicals (all others need not apply).: This movie is in black and white (better still, in black and red!) and I don't mean colorwise. It's your standard politically-correct hagiography where good guys ooze beatitude, bad guys reek evil, and if you don't root for the former, you belong with the latter. Like history told this way? If so, then you're gonna love it; if not, at least you'll get some laughs.Mind you, it's not that I object the fake look, dubbed dialogue, hammy overacting or holier-than-thou attitude of everyone concerned in this dated political flick from the sixties; I mean, we were all pretty much ridiculous ourselves back then. But Joan Baez's awful lyrics and worst wailing tear apart the movie's only redeeming asset: Ennio Morricone's beautiful music score. Now that's a true crime!So you've been warned!
__label__2 A Spark for Social Reform: The purpose of this book is to heighten awareness about consumerism and ultimately bring about dramatic change in our society. The audience is primarily Americans, though the book has been well received in several foreign countries. De Graaf and his associates present powerful evidence from a wide collection of sources. Their argument is persuasive and well documented. They address environmental, social, financial, spiritual, physical and mental indicators of health in our society. Affluenza has made me more aware of how I spend my money, time and intellectual effort by highlighting some of our societies weaknesses. I enjoyed reading the book because it made me question some of my practices. The authors throw down the gauntlet by challenging many "American principles." Overall, the argument is sound and effective, if a bit dramatic at times. A copy of should come free with every new BMW, satellite TV dish and MBA degree. America needs it.
__label__2 Love this movie!: I love that I can find the older movies here at Amazon. I have bought several from different sellers and all have been great! I just love Spenser Tracy and this old b&w is one of my FAV's
__label__1 Not Just "Borderline" Terrible--It Is Terrible!: Thank your "Lucky Star" if you miss this one. This movie is so bad I don't know where to start. I don't like Madonna to begin with. It's bad enough that I have to hear her belt out her crappy pop ditties on the radio and see her face plastered on magazine covers, but this so-called "movie" is quite possibly the worst thing she's unleashed on the public. It's even worse than "Body of Evidence" and that's saying something. Maybe I'm prejudiced against Madonna, but I was willing to give this movie a chance...boy, do I regret it. I want my two hours back.
__label__1 Madonna is an embarrassment...: This movie is So very bad on so many different levels, that it is almost beneath any serious movie lover or critic to waste time viewing it. Madonna is at her all time low, and it is a low that few stars ever reach. She is a terribly bad actress and this time out, she made even her die-hard fans cringe in embarassment for her. Simply put, there is no guesswork here...there is not a redeaming quality in this movie. The acting, script, direction, tone, pace, etc., are all at an extremely shoddy level, and DAMN is she getting painful to look at. The only comfort comes in the knowledge of the FACT that this movie was completely shunned by not only critics but by the public as well. Even Madonna's legion of fans couldn't get her out of this one. It bombed on every level.
__label__2 Great Movie, But...: The storyline was superb. Rupert was great. But Madonna...what were you thinking??? Her accent annoyed me throughout the whole movie. Is she American??? Is she English??? The cross between sounds Australian which is irritating. Apart from Madonna's terrible acting, this movie is held together pretty well.
__label__1 Bad: The video kept timing out. The screen would go black or multi color. I had to wait for the movie to restart every 10 minutes
__label__2 An amazing fun MOM book: This book was wonderful. I am a SAHM. I thought that Meredith did an excellent job on the book. I loved all the relationships and the e-mails going back and forth. What a refreshing format. This wasn't just a fun book though, it was deep and caused me to think deeper about my life and my relationships with my husband, kids, and other moms. I read this book in about a day. It was too good to put down.shannon
__label__1 Not the Planet of the Apes: This has everything to do with the recent movie and nothing to do with the real book. The real book had messages that were really lost in the recent film, it was close to a modern day Gulliver's Travels, raising questions about how we treat animals, our science and our society.This will no doubt be fairly close to the recent film, which is okay hokum. Excepting the massive holes in the plot of the recent movie... How did horses arrive on the planet? Where were the non-chimps on the station etc?
__label__2 Wonderful perspective shift!: After reading the Ophelia books and the studies on the many and varied problems teenage girls face, this was a wonderful and refreshing perspective. Teenage girls who are self-confidant, not worried about pleasing others with who they are, eloquent, etc. How encouraging! I'm looking forward to reaping some of these benefits of homeschooling...
__label__1 ???: Don't even remember watching it, could not have been very good! Whoever created this should find another career. Best of luck!
__label__1 HORRIBLE, WASTE OF TIME!: This book is one of the worst books I've ever read. None of the research from the Bible is even remotely close to the context it was written in. Can Katz even do a reasonable job at researching information? It doesn't even deserve one star.
__label__1 Women leave for all the same reasons: I wasn't looking for a book on why men leave... but on the fear of commitment. I have enjoyed this author's other book about Zen and falling in love... and browsing the first pages intrigued me.I will never understand why anyone thinks this is just a masculine problem. I think that certain people, for whatever reason, value their own personal freedom above anything else, yet everyone, of course, would like to have a loving partner to go through life with. I wish this book had more insight into how TWO people like this, male, female... whatever... can find freedom within the confines of relationship.
__label__1 Dont Bother.............Wait for it to play on local cable: i loved the first mummy movie and had very high expectations for the second, even though i missed it in the theaters. The day it was released on dvd, i ran out to get it to find my local store sold out. My roomate however manged to snag it for his collection and upon watching it that nite, was glad that fate stopped me from buying a truly overrated , summer popcorn flick.special effects were a plenty but def. less striking than the first one, the computerized scorpion king at the end was almost as bad as the computerized satan at the end of SPAWN. the story was kinda weak. But its a sequel i guess.Dont waste your time. rental only or wait for it on TNT.
__label__1 pretty bad: If you loved the first one, this one might be worth a rent from the video store, but i thought that they were both pretty bad.
__label__1 This should have been a good movie...: but it really wasn't. The returning characters display none of the character traits that made them entertaining in the first movie. The movie simply careens, in a nearly plot free fashion, from one set-piece of computer enhanced combat to another. Now, I like a good, violent action movie as much as the next guy, but this one wasn't good. Watching it reminded me of watching somebody play the "Mortal Kombat" type video games of the 90's. If the producers had spent half of what went toward special effects on a better script, this movie could have lived up to its predecessor.
__label__2 The Mummy Returns: I enjoyed the movie very much although some of the computer bad guys were a bit over the top. The fact that Oded Fehr (Ardeth Bay)has more scenes helped alot. This film is entertaining and also answers many questions left over from the 1st film.
__label__1 Forgot to mention this...: But Universal did at the very least included DTS! to this Blu-ray! as well as the first movie.By the way, this movie on the whole. Was not very good and was a bit way too campy.
__label__1 the mummy returns: I find it very hard to believe that some people enjoyed this movie so much that they gave it a five star rating. If this gets five stars, what do good films get?!. This makes no sense. The film is poor. Hre are a few thoughts...Acting: I've seen better acting in fifth grade musicals.Plot: Plot, what plot?Dialog: Laughable.Character Development: The characters are so static that I felt like I was watching a soap opera set in 1930s Egypt in which many things arbitrarily exploded.I will praise this film in one way: it is better than Hollow Man (but then again, sitting in an empty parking lot watching a dumpster for 90 minutes is more satisfying than watching Hollow Man). In closing, my solemn hope is that the mummy won't return again.
__label__1 ryan hickneys mummy review: this moview could of been much better. it was as dumb as dumb can get. the only good thing about it is that the actors played good. i am sure the director was feeling low when he found the rating in the theaters. BYE
__label__1 Don't buy this DVD: Unless you want to line Universal's pocket, I'd advise you to stay away from this video.Don't get me wrong though, I like the movie. It's pretty good escapist entertainment. I don't try to read to much into such movies. It was fun. But Universal is most likely going to release this title in an Ultimate Edition package just like the last one. They also created Ultimate Editions for American Pie, Meet Joe Black and a few others. So if you like this movie wait for the Ultimate Edition.
__label__2 Great Special Effects: Great photography and outstanding special effects. A move to see over and over just to enjoy the visual presentation.
__label__1 It stunk: This movie isnt even worth rental.Everthing was boring and the mummy was fully regenerated in the first 30 minutes.It wasnt evenworth the one star it got.
__label__1 What a waste of time: This refers to the Australian Region 4 Collector's Edition. The picture quality is excellent. The DTS soundtrack (yes, this is standard on the R4 DVD unlike the R1)is of reference quality and quite outstanding in dynamic range (especially in the water-wall sequence). Unfortunately, the film was a total waste of time and I think studios should be paying audiences to watch films like this. No where near as good as the original -very formulaic and it felt almost like a cartoon with its over reliance on CGI. I scanned through most of the movie and I feel sorry for everyone who thinks this is worth buying. Even if a free copy was offered I would not accept -because I would never watch it again! And the bonus materials! Who cares about this when the film is so pathetic. I hope I'm not a minority who thinks film substance is still more important than its technical merits. I have invested in home theatre to enjoy films not gunfire, car chases and explosions.
__label__2 Good short history: Publisher: Wilson's Creek National Battlefield Foundation; 4th Edition (1992)Language: EnglishASIN: 1-881366-01-4170 pages, maps, pictures, indexI found this book in the bookstore at Wilson's Creek and bought it immeadlty. Ed Bearss' narration captures the immediacy of the situation, placing you on the line. This small book will not disappoint the reader there and will convey solid information about the battle. The balance between detail and narration is maintained throughout the book. Neither takes over and we end with a short but very solid history.
__label__1 OK as a monocular, not a binocular: I could not get these to form a single image of a star or planet because the two tubes are not exactly parallel. I do not know whether that was a quality control issue of the pair I had, or the overall quality specification is so poor that misalignment is typical. Mine went back. A properly aligned pair would be a considerable bargain. If you buy these, buy them from a place with a good return policy. Keep the packaging and invoice.
__label__1 RE: Mission Impossible: By and large, the movie fails because it strays too far from the premise of the TV show and ventures into 007 and Bourne territory.No IMF team, no suspense, poor story.The TV series is far superior.
__label__1 Impossible: Your impossible misson? Trying to watch this movie, and finding anything comprehensible about the plot. Tom Cruise said in an interview that it IS possible to follow the plot (but, obviously there is a problem if he has to point that out!). But does that mean one has to rewind certain sections five times, to get all the dialogue details? Movies are not like books. In theaters, you can't flip back five pages, to refresh in your mind who a certain character is. So things should be spelled out with CLARITY. Something this film is woefully lacking. Having said that, DePalma is a great stylist-director, and as a music video, this isn't a total loser. But as a movie, it is.
__label__1 Such shit: This movie is the worst of modern movie making: big budget, small art. I couldn't wait for it to be over.
__label__1 I was dissappointed: Fans of the TV series should be dissappointed and angry that a good show has gotten into the wrong hands. There is none of the intrigue or ingenuity that was so integral to the series. The movie could have and should have been made under a different title. Why was it necessary to spoil the memory of a great TV series with this nonsense?Without revealing any of the plot, let me just say that the denouement is particularly awful, in that it puts one of the main characters from the TV show in a very negative light. This particular plot element was completely unnecessary and un-called for. No reason to see this at all.
__label__2 Nice Family Drama: This is a nice family drama that explores a son's conflicted relationship with his father. It shows the sad consequences that result when father's spend much time trying to become rich and famous and calously neglect to care for and love their sons.
__label__2 Get this book and go!: The People's Guide is a pure delight, a labor of love about Mexico. It's a travel book that is actually fun to read. It's also full of useful information about just about everything; how to travel, where to stay, how to stay healthy, how to deal with the law, some basics on the language, and much more. And every bit of it feels like advice from someone who has learned it all through years of experience, some of it painful, most of it joyful.What it is not is a book listing all the hotels, restaurants, stores, museums, and so forth. (There is a short section - The Best of Mexico - with specific suggestions, but it's just a starting point.) If your approach to travel is as footloose and unplanned as the authors, this may be the only book you need. If you like a little more structure, you will want to supplement it with traditional guidebooks for the areas you plan to visit.
__label__2 Book was a marvel of technical details and fiction: Guy Durham masterfully tells a spy tale with grity details of the processes along the way. He includes a myriad of interesting characters and plot twists in a live-action way, Bravo!
__label__1 Brittle Fail: These cases are super brittle, I bought one recently from this seller, and in the past on ebay. In both instances the cases have been tough fits. The cases are SUPER brittle and will more than likely crack on you while screwing them on (like mine did). I am pretty upset at the cost of them for how cheap they are. I now have a nice transparent case with a huge crack down the middle and a DVD drive that wont open. .... not worth it
__label__2 Just what I was looking for!: This book is full of many wonderful ideas on how to achieve your own 'white' space. The effect is fresh and romantic, and somehow soothing. The images within are simply elegant. Lovely, and highly recommended!
__label__2 Alarm works when power is out!: A lot of the battery backup alarm clocks only provide for backup of the settings. If the power is out when the alarm is suppose to go off, you're out of luck. This one is different. It has a backup "mini-buzzer" alarm that will go off at the set alarm time even if you have the alarm set to radio. I'm in a situation where I cannot afford to wake up late. It's comforting knowing I don't have to worry about the power being out and the alarm not sounding.
__label__2 WING FLY HIGH !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!: Love this cd to bad it was the last Wings recored, all were gems the lp did not far good on release but it was still great.
__label__2 Yes, It Is Better: Of all McCartney's lost albums, this is the one that most richly deserves to be found. Old Siam Sir sits with other forgotten Mccartney classic rockers such as Girls' School, Soily and The Mess all of which fit neatly with the best Rock and Roll he wrote for that other group (in many ways they are rawer than most of what he wrote for them). Arrow Through Me is one of those delicate pieces that McCartney writes that somehow manage to rock in a subtle way. The Rockestra highlights work well on this album, but are perhaps better on Concert for Kampuchea. The generally stripped down sound of this album allows the listener to appreciate the musicianship of Wings Mark 3. Give it a listen, you want be disappointed, particularly if you like the better moments on the Mccartney album
__label__2 Excellent: All the Nancy Drew books are excellent - perfect to develop a 8 or 9 year olds love for reading. The stories are all so interesting. We cherish our mother daughter routine of reading these books together every night. Also the characters are wholesome. There is a line drawn between good and evil. Some of the more contemporary books like Junie B. Jones have main characters that I would never want my daughter to emulate with bad attitudes, etc. Nancy Drew is not afraid of ANYTHING or ANYONE and is always finding adventure while solving mysteries.
__label__2 Story of Saab as told by a European.: The author has several automotive books to his credit and it shows. In his history of this classic car, told from a British perspective, the text is easy to read, and the author displays a thorough understanding of how cars work. There are plenty of excellent photos, some in color but mostly not. I learned *why* the ignition key is on the floor (safety feature), and got further insights into this small company's heritage as an innovator, e.g. how, with the 96, they had an extremely aerodynamic car rivalled only by the Citroen DS, or how they insisted, for safety reasons, on using heavier sheet metal than other makers, explaining its enduring status among automotive brands.
__label__1 disturbing: We received this book as a gift. I like the photo illustration concept but the book content itself is disturbing. There are so many better books out there to spend your money on.
__label__1 BEWARE: This is not an appropriate book for children! As a child, I myself found it highly disturbing. Although the pictures are cute, I would never allow my child to read it.
__label__1 Magic Thumb Tip: The thumb is very small (more for a child than an adult) and you could not fit any cloth inside to do any type of trick. Would absolutely not recommend this product at all.
__label__2 Meooooooooww: When I read this title I thought it was going to be a funny story but WOWWW was it so much more. This is the sexiest story I have every read. Dammmmmm
__label__2 A classic which keeps you guessing.: The only thing really wrong with Morse is that he smokes too much. If you want a really good read in your mysteries, here it is.
__label__2 Cute - I used them to decorate a cake.: I used these to decorate my boyfriend's birthday cake. I have to admit, they were a bigger hit than my cake! lol!
__label__2 Yes, good movies are still being made!!!!!: With today's current crop of movies, it is easy to think that quality films that make you think might have gone the way of the dodo. However, The Insider is a BIG exception to the rule. Don't let the long running time or the fact that it may seem like any other A & E documentary discourage you. This movie is potboiler that keeps you glued to the screen and howling at every the injustice of it all.One of the greatest compliments for this movie would have to be the fact that I watched it with five of my friends who could care less about current events or journalistic integrity, yet all of them sat through every single minute of it absolutely riveted to the screen.It is kind of discouraging seeing the self-censorship and the "chilling effect" on the media that's taken place since the events of the film. However, the film ends on a high note and is well worth watching if you enjoy great cinema!
__label__2 Great Suspensful Drama: This is a great movie starring russell crowe and al pacino. It was well worthy of it's oscar nomination for best picture. The movie builds with tension as the it moves along. The DVD has some great features and great picture quality. The movie is over 2 hours but as with any great film time is not an issue. This is well worth the money to buy.
__label__2 the best: i sometimes think of that final list of the finest movies i've ever seen. after much soul searching and viewing films for over 50 years, i narrowed it down to amadeus, private ryan, manchurian candidate (frank sinatra), high noon and no country. after everything shakes out, THE INSIDER would have to top the list. acting, directing, music, script and subject matter. i just wish it was on blu ray.
__label__2 Riveting: Man was I upset when this thing ended after just three hours. For anyone who's ever worked in a big glass skyscraper this film is truly cathartic. I think it is too narrow to focus on the journalistic or the tobacco-industry elements of The Insider. Like HEAT before it, Mann's film is a highly dramatized portrayal of ethics in the modern world. Truly a remarkable film that earns everything it asks for from the audience. On a lesser note, I also think it is something really unique when big-budget Hollywood productions such as this one eschew explosions and spaceships to focus on telling a human story. Cheesy as it may sound, I believe a film like this is much closer to gargantuan filmaking than... well let's justs say GLADIATOR.
__label__1 Pretty much a waste of time: The story itself, which is based on real events, is interesting but the filmmakers made it into a weak feature film. There is too much unnecessary information and the "60 minutes" peoples' portrayal is too harsh. Some scenes are repeated during the film and the overall dialogue can [at times] put you to sleep.I give this film two stars instead of one because of Russel Crowe's superb acting.
__label__1 Not What I Expected: This books has loads of information, but it is in black and white and the fonts make it difficult to hold one's attention. I would not purchase this again.
__label__2 to dream of love: This movie is unique and beautiful. Especially the character Tom (played by Jeremy Davies).Still reeling from its beauty, which really, was in all the little details. It was made like a dream, some characters over the top, some more real than real.See it if you can.
__label__1 The Emperor Has No Clothes: Too bad there is not a rating of MINUS-stars. This film is garbage; boring, pretentious, and meaningless. Perhaps other reviews can attach their own fantasies and for them this DOA film may say something. But I found it an irritating waste of time. When a script and the characters within it have no definition, no relevance, and no entertainment value - watching it becomes either self-torture or an exercise in pretending that it serves some arty vision. This is the only time that Mel Gibson let me down. I understand he donated his services to this production and, in that case, he was very much overpaid.
__label__2 great buy, great hair and skin!: I bought this for myself, and upon using it just once the difference in my skin and hair was obvious. No itching or dryness! I promptly bought another for my mother- she is in her 80s and has said this has helped her skin and hair so much. We gave them as gifts to many people in 08, and every one of them has gone on to buy one to give as a gift to someone they love too. Honestly; easy to install, easy to use, instant results- great value for money!
__label__2 My Philips Norelco Epilator: I was really pleased after using my new epilator, it definitely exceeded my expectations and I don't need to epilate again for at least a month easily. I had a Braun epilator earlier I had used for years which was much more expensive but I must say the Philips epilator is as good, if not better.
__label__2 Awsome: I love this product it's awsome. I have to admit it is painful a little the first time, but after that the pain goes away. you'll love the feeling of your skin after you use it, very smooth and clean. I totally recommend it.
__label__2 First epilator I've used: I'm not sure how this compares to other epilators, but I think it does a pretty good job for the price. It doesn't get all my hair out, but it gets 95% of it after a few passes. I think with any epilator, it's gonna hurt, but since the hair doesn't grow back as fast, and comes back finer it is sooo worth it. The more you use it, the less it hurts, so don't give up, it gets better! Also, I've noticed that even with occasional use (about 6 times a year), about 25% of my hair has stopped growing back, and what has come back is much finer. Unfortunately, I have such fair skin that I need to remove the hair either by epilating or waxing since you can still see the folicle after shaving! The epilator is much more financially and environmentally better than having to wax for me.
__label__2 Looking for the perfect gift for the man who has everything?: Here it is. I purchased this for my Dad, 79 years young. Finding anything for him, that he hasn't seen, heard or done is very difficult. Imagine my surprise when he sent me a note stating this was the BEST gift he'd received in a long time! I also bought him "the Evolution of Useful Things"... same message! Both are super-duper gifts!
__label__1 To engineer is human - I engineered a new beverage coaster!: I purchased this book at the Duke University bookstore, after the recommendation from a professor at another institution.Petroski's prose is extremely dense and verbose. His style consists of run-on sentences which require several readings. Even if it is technically (grammatically) correct, it is extremely difficult to read. The subject matter is dry to begin with, however, Petroski does nothing to liven it. I am an engineer also, and am not threatened by the technical information (admittedly lifted from his students' term papers). I have chemical engineering textbooks that read like a novel. Hopefully the courses he teaches are clearer than this muddled prose.Petroski is certainly an engineer. He has engineered an elegant method of making money from saps like us. I successfully engineered Petroski's book into a beverage coaster to help drown the sorrows of wasting $14 on this book.
__label__1 Save yourself the time...: The book itself was in good condition and promptly shipped.... however, the content of the book leaves a lot to be desired. What could have been accomplished in one chapter is drawn out repeatedly to cover 200 pages. Very boring. Overall message is one of merit, but too much repetition.
__label__1 Had SO much potential....: I tried really hard to like this book. The first couple of chapters were really promising, but then the author suddenly lost track of where she was going. Stilted broken part-way descriptive sentences. No serious romance going on. I really didn't care if they ended up together. I suggest Karen Marie Moning for really great time travel romance, or for the serious time travel enthusiast - Diana Gabaldon's Outlander. Both authors have never written a dud. This was definitely a dud, no offense intended to the author of course. It just didn't happen.
__label__1 I liked the backcover blurb, but...: This book was romantic drivel. It made me think it was pulled directly from the pages of an early 1970s Harlequin. While wonderful at the time, this book will leave today's modern romance reader cold. Latter Day Saints, this is a book you can sink your teeth into.
__label__1 Don't waste your money: Although they appeared to be working (they glowed, and we'd hear the occasional ZAP) it didn't take 6 months before one of them completely stopped glowing, and they made no dent at all in the mosquito population - the reason we bought them. Not worth it at all.
__label__1 Bug Zapper: I was hoping for something with more power to actually zap the bugs but this one does not. I even purchased two sets. The light does cause the bugs to swarm around it but it does not have enough power to actually kill the bugs.When it is on the light setting it isn't enough light to even guide you along a path. I am very disappointed in it.We will be purchasing an electric bug zapper soon to replace these.
__label__1 Poor stitching, doesn't hold up: I recently purchased 8 of these bras and although I loved the fit, I'm afraid that 4 out of 8 have had an identical problem in stitching at the center top part of the bra. All of them have unraveled stitching during the first wash causing the underwire to poke out. All were hand washed and were hung to dry so I'm afraid it can't be blamed on machines. I'm greatly disappointed
__label__2 Works with AVIC-D3: The new ipods do not charge with the pioneer cable, and this was the solution to the problem. Now my 4th gen nano charges no problem!
__label__2 (3.8)stars still good: This is not like their first two albums but it's still heavy.They don't have the deathcore they had in their first album and some of it in caitiff choir but it's still has the metalcore with brutal breakdowns and more melodic singing i guess.This is kind of like the band a day to remember just not to big with the pop thing.If you own their first two albums just know this,there's more clean singing,nick doesn't have the deathcore growls anymore,and not as brutal but yeah still brutal.So i can't say you might not like this but there's is some good heavy songs is okay.
__label__2 So far - très bon: AS described, but I think you need to know some French before you can use this product effectively.
__label__1 Is it over yet?: After 4 months of trying to plow through this book, I finally gave up on page 121 and read the last page. I kept hoping things would get better; The pace would pick up and I might care about these people. To no avail. A thourough disappointment. start to abbreviated finish.
__label__1 Crap: with all the add on to this game a simple versus DLC that allows you to play up to four or even two players in your house (split screen) would be good, but no they made it online only or one player so no internet no fun. it's not worth it, buy any other burnout except this one. and if you want to have fun wreaking cars and people get (Saints Row The Third) or (Grand Theft Auto) you can drive around getting into all sorts of trouble. Not a bad idea the open land driving but we see that in the GTA's this is Burnout the open land should be the addition
__label__2 You're Gonna This Book: This book is a must read!!!! but not unless you've read City Of Masks and City of Stars. Hoffman creates and incredible world in (unfortunately) the last installment of this AMAZING series. You'll want to stay in Talia forever. This book had the perfect combination of love, adventure, suspense, and wit. For those of you who read the first 2 books to me City of Flowers was very shocking but in a good way. *****
__label__1 We Are The World meets Journey: When the cast of We Are The World and the band members of Journey had illegitimate children they named them Doug and the Mystics. Doug and the Mysics successfully create Prozaic induced songs about what seem to be important issues. Later these songs proove to have no real central concept or meaning.
__label__1 TV goes out after 90 days: We spent $90 on this tv. It worked fine for 95 days or so. Then the tv goes out. You push the power button and nothing happens. We have tried different outlets and everything. And guess what, it only has a 90 day warranty on labor. And the labor is $60!!! Don't buy it.
__label__2 Faith in this Movie: Nortan (Fight Club; American History X), Elfman (Sitcom "Dharma and Greg"), and Stiller (Meet the Parents) light it up in this warm-hearted comedy about 3 friends from grade school who haven't seen each other in year, now thrown back together when Elfman comes running back into their lives. Nortan and Stiller, now clergymen, (Nortan a Catholic Priest, Stiller a Jewish Rabbi) both find the old friendship they once knew in their beloved tom-boyish beauty of a friend Elfman. But throughout it all, there is denial, lying, antitrust, and a passionate love triangle forms. Now who will end up following their faith and who will end up following their hearts? Nortan, Elfman, and Stiller deliver a spectacular and heart gripping performance in this romantic comedy that shouldn't be missed by men nor women alike.
__label__2 Sweet romantic comedy...: Ben Stiller and Edward Norton play best friends Jake and Brian, a rabbi and a priest who are both strong leaders in their congregations. When their friend Anna visits them, both friends fall for her and find themselves questioning their faiths.This is a sweet and often funny movie that is well written and acted by the cast. Religion can be a tough subject to base a comedy around, but Keeping the Faith does pretty well. The plot itself seems to unwind a bit near the end, but Ben Stiller and Edward Norton keep it afloat pretty well.This is a pretty good movie, so I recommend it for a Saturday afternoon.
__label__2 Love it!: This has always been one of my favorite movies. It is one of my favorite roles for all of the actors, especially Edward Norton, but they all did beautifully. It was refreshing to see Ben Stiller in a more serious, yet still comedic movie.
__label__2 A good collection but......: This collection features some of their hit singles plus one new track "Desperado", it includes the #1 single in Italy "Movin' On" which was originally released in 1984, the beautiful ballads "Dreamland Paradise", "Leaving Now" and "Smile", and the amazing "Excessive Love". All the other tracks are pop-dance songs. They did many other songs that are not included here as the pop-jazz "Broadway", the beautiful semi new age ballad "Shine" and many others.
__label__2 After 21 Years....: ...I finally saw this film again and it wasn't too bad, though typical of the time it came out, as far as sound, photography, SPFX and acting, though the four leads were great: Randy Quaid, the beautiful Kate Capshaw (this was only her second film), Max Von Sydow and of course Christopher Plummer. It arrived from Amazon just days before Eddie Albert died but I didn't get around to watching it till a few days after that, so it was kinda bittersweet to watch. I could barely recall anything of it since I'd seen it only once at its initial theatrical release so this was a nice reminder. I recommend this to anyone looking for 99 minutes to kill if they've nothing else to do.Unintentional funny moment: When the paramedics try reviving a dead Mrs. Matusik the actress moves a split second before the paddles touch her.
__label__2 Suprisingly enjoyable: "Blow" is a well done film depicting an era. Though the point of "blow" is kind of hard to figure out, it is an interesting movie to watch, and you find yourself mysteriously rooting for Jung as he rises and falls.The best part of this film is the first part detailing Jung's rise to fame, and his doomed relationship with his first girlfriend. The shots of California and the beach are the quintessential way that we all wish it truly were.Somewhat depressing, somewhat amusing, and always entertaining, you won't go wrong adding "Blow" to your collection. Depp is always good in all his roles.
__label__1 DEPP COULDN'T SAVE THIS ONE: This film portrays large scale drug dealers as guerilla marketing experts. It's long on make-up and period costume and short on cool dialogue or good acting. Hispanic actors portray Columbians using exaggerated accents and they appear more middle eastern than latin american. Good cameos by Ray Liotta and Pee-Wee Herman. The film is based on one convict's memoir, and it presents an interesting point or two, but everything in this film has been covered before, in better films.
__label__1 Great movie!: I really liked this movie! They picked the perfect character for Pee Wee Herman to play. I thought the movie was really good except for the constant whinning of his mother! What about me???? What about me??? I't get's really old after awhile listening to her complain! Otherwise I thought it was a great movie! Johnny Depp was real convincing as a drug dealer. My suggestion by this movie!
__label__2 Crime does not pay. No honor among thieves. A very good life lesson based on a true story: The story is interesting and engaging from the beginning till the end.It's a very good life lesson based on a true story. It showed a "big" drug dealer can make tons of money. However it also shows crime does not pay and there is no honor among thieves. They set up each other. They stole from each other, etc.It's absolutely worth viewing.
__label__1 Heavy handed: While the acting, directing, and general storytelling was solid, I thought the movie was little more than a heavy-handed morality play disguised as a self-indulgant biographical exposÉ. Truth is, I just didn't find the characters interesting or sympathetic and the ending made me groan. They probably got funding from the US government to present the anti-drug moral lesson.
__label__1 Hogan's halo hailed on by this half-witted horror...: The first two films were wonderful fun, and worth repeat viewing. I only managed to sit in the theater until the end of this one by mustering great fortitude. Compared to the first two episodes, "Los Angeles" is lamentably lame. Skip it.
__label__1 Please no more!: The third installment of Crocodile Dundee starring a subdued Paul Hogan takes place this time in Los Angeles,where he somehow finds an plot do steal some paintings. The ever lovable guy from 'downunder', is less lovable and more pathetic looking this go around. I know he's getting older, but did this second sequal really need to be made? The script and plot are something not even a t.v. movie of the week would show. Like the old saying, " Don't fix it if it aint broken". Well it's broken, but please Hollywood, don't try and fix it!
__label__1 Not the Buddy Holly I know and love: My husband bought this CD for me during a recent visit to the UK, and I don't like it. I'm a Buddy Holly fan, but sound quality is poor, and it doesn't compare to his later recordings in terms of arrangements and singing style. Not my cup of tea.
__label__1 Pathetic movie feels like a made for TV movie! Rent it first: This movie literally borrows scenes from many action movie. It is full of plot holes...The story is OK. The DVD has OK amount of features. Rent this pathetic movie first(unless you like Treat Williams or B grade action movies!). I would go into details about the many plot holes but that would ruin it for other readers/viewers. Just be sure you rent this movie first before you buy it!
__label__2 Amazing: Camus's novel truley symbolizes the coldness of modern life. He creates one of the great literary characters of all time and paints a powerful image of mankind's true state. The novel makes the reader question their own lapse into the existentialist circle and why it happens. In short, it is one of the classics.
__label__2 read it for your own reaction.: This novel is absurd. This is not arguable. The point of this novel is that you react to it -- you see Meursault and his absurd way of going about life, and you feel the need to change your own.
__label__2 Profound, Poetic, and Disturbing: A terrific read. Very dry, engaging, and clips along at a good pace. I finished it in less than three hours, and felt that I had witnessed part of myself on Camus' stage. M. Meursault is, for the most part, an ordinary person who has been benumbed by a daily existence of "getting by." Finding himself so dulled, that finally, he is a mere spectator in his own life. "Effect" instead of "Cause." The story begins with a death, and ends with a death. In the folds of each is found new life, whether it is his Maman's "fiancee" or Meursault's own rebirth of consciousness in his final minutes. Perhaps through this story, we can all find something of ourselves in M. Meursault, and heed the warning that seems to glare in mile-high neon. Be "Cause." Not "Effect." Get out and LIVE. Live heroically instead of being a spectator or simply "getting by.&quot
__label__2 L'Etranger, The Stranger: I picked up The Stranger expecting the worst. With a sigh I sat down to read it, and about an hour later, I put it down. I sighed again, shrugged and then ate lunch. At dinner, I told my father that I had finished reading it, and my reaction to the text. He grinned and waved his fork. "That's exactly what Camus was writing about." Confused, I read the book again. And this time, I liked it. The more I read it, the easier it was to understand. I felt connected to the characters, and sympathized with the events in thier lives. The Stranger nows has a special space in my bookcase.
__label__2 A Good Classic: I think everybody should read this who likes existentialism. it is a very quick read though. i think it would make a very great movie.
__label__2 goth background research: "and the stranger - the killing of an arab"It was those lyrics in Killing An Arab by The Cure that made me want to read this book. Plus, in high school, I thought I was an existentialist.This story is really interesting and a great book to read if you're at all into the Cure - it's like adding some street cred or something - not really, but I feel somehow more orderly by having read it.It's short, easy to read and gives an interesting view of life - it is written by quite a well known (ie. accessible) philosopher after all. One could call it a nice intro to existentialism or an addition to your goth music research, cuz you know you love to research music.
__label__1 SO overrated: This is a top contender for the worst book ever written. I thought about giving it a tied position with Pamela Anderson's _Star_, but upon reflection I have decided that I would rather read _Star_ again than read _The Stranger_ again, although I would rather be eaten alive by rabid wolverines than do either. This book is so bad that it is painful for me to read it. If I had a time machine, I would pay to have Camus beaten to death on a deserted beach, ultimately preventing this disaster from ever coming into existence.
__label__2 Not existentialist - depressed!: I read The Stranger when I was young but didn't really get much out of it. I recently reread it and was struck by the lack of emotion on the part of the protagonist, Muersault. Forget existentialist - this man was depressed. He has all the hallmarks of it - doesn't care about anything, has no joy in his existence. It doesn't so much bother me that he didn't care about his mother's death; she was older, apparently not in good health and they weren't close. But what does bother me is the casual way he deals with the murder he committed. It seems almost beside the point- the man he killed had done nothing to Muersault justifying the murder. More than anything else, his flat attitude reminded me of the murderers in In Cold Blood. There were some serious mental health issues that this man had.
__label__2 Existentialism at its finest!: The Stranger was a summer reading assignment for my senior year of high school, and I devoured every word of it. Albert Camus should be read by every student of literature,history, and philosophy. His prose is fluid, his style uncompromising. He reflects the lack of definite meaning that life sometimes has. Camus earned his place in the French literary canon. It is time that the American literary canon adds him among their elite as well. I hope to read this novel again, but in French.
__label__2 Great Book, I couldn't put it down: After you get a few chapters into the book, it grabs you. You get so into it that every time you put it down, all you can think about is the book. This was also one of those books that your sad when it ends because you want to read more of it. Good thing there is 2 more! This is a must read for all fantasy and science fiction readers!
__label__2 Good CD dictionary that can be better: This review is for CD version. I agree with most of previous reviewers that this is top notch American English dictionary.Some previous reviewers complained that the new words are not inserted into the main body of the dictionary. This could be a problem for the printed version. For CD version, this is not a problem. When looking up a word, I cannot tell if it is from the original or from the new word list.I do not understnad why the multimedia function is not on the CD. If it uses too much hard disk space, it can be made available from CD, as Random House did. No pronouncing symbols can compare with the real sound.
__label__1 No support for low screen res: The interface may be horrific or it may be brilliant; either way, I wouldn't know as that I am running on a laptop with a vertical resolution of 480 dpi. When running at this resolution, the bottom of the dialogue boxes are chopped off - scroll bars, lists of words, et al - instead of resizing as would be expected of even a sub-par user interface.And tech-support's response to my dilemma? Increase your resolution. Sorry, it's a laptop with a fixed resolution; not an option. Guess I'm stuck with Encarta's less-than-inspiring definitions of words.
__label__2 Excellent Dictionary: I found this dictionary outstanding quality. As a person who's english is not a first language, I love the unlimited variety words and the detailed descriptions of each words. I hoped if the book isn't so big and heavy but I guess it's impossible for this dictonary. I like to recommend to evrybody and I have so. For new buyers, you won't regret. People might think this dictionary is not much different from the oxford but THIS is quiet an extraordinary...
__label__1 not the worse film or acting...: but definately not the best or even above average. why does kidman have to inhale rapidly like that after she finishes a sentence (referring her private video segments)? isn't she a trained actress that has learned breath control? i understand she wanted to protray a psycho-ditz, but... anyway, i watched it to the end, i guess mostly because it was based on a true story.
__label__2 Fame is so important: It is not really my sort of movie, but it turned out to be a real winner. It is a story of a woman who wants to be famous at all costs. She ends out having her husband murdered and then... Overall it made me think.I thought it was well acted particularly by Kidman. The film was well filmed.Worth seeing.
__label__1 A Train Wreck: This film really misses its mark. Billed as a black comedy, it fails to deliver any satirical bite whatsoever. Suzanne Stone's frequent video segments where she speaks directly to the camera and the flashforwards to some sort of Jerry Springer-like show are painful to watch. Yeah, Nicole Kidman is extremely sexy (duh), but it's not nearly enough to overcome her marginal acting, the clumsy dialog and the amateurish direction.See this movie for all the humor of "Dying Young" coupled with the social commentary of a SpongeBob episode.
__label__1 0 Star Presentation of a 5 Star Movie; Sony/Image Lied: This is apropos of the DVD version. This movie is pan and scan, despite what the description says and what it says on the back of the box. It is 1.33:1 format and even says at the beginning of the film: "This film has been modified from its original format-It has been formatted to fit this screen." If you got stung, demand a refund. What nitwit would release a film in an obsolete format?
__label__1 What a pity: Thankfully I only paid [money] for this cd single. The original edit is the only decent version on the cd and that only goes for 4 minutes. Why do they pay dj's to remix these songs when the remixes are awful and the original in infinitely better. I think dj's have stopped trying and just put out any rubbish for cd fillers. My advice would be don't buy this until you have listened to it first.
__label__2 Can we escape our past ?: This is the central question explored by Conrad in Lord Jim. Jim is ultimately a character who inspires our sympathy due to his inability to find reconcilliation for his one tragic moment of weakness. In him we find a person of tremendous potential that remains unrealized as the tragic circumstances of his abandoning his post aboard the Patna continually haunt him and the associated guilt drives him to isolation.Conrad successfully explores the concepts of bravery, cowardice,guilt and the alternative destinies that an individual may be driven to by these qualities.The narrative can be a bit confusing at times as Marlowe relates the tale by recalling his encounters with Jim. The book reminded very much of Somerset Maugham's THE RAZOR"S EDGE" in style. However I believe that Maugham did a much better job of incorporating the narrator into the flow of the story. Overall LORD JIM is a wonderful classic novel that I highly recommend.
__label__1 A Little Hard to Follow for a Timeless Classic: Perhaps it is the nineteenth century writing style or the nautical terminology, but the pronoun-laced conversational passages have left me wondering who was on first, or who was the first mate.Conrad was a pathbreaker in the subjects he treated and no doubt had interesting experiences, but I prefer his other works.
__label__1 Couldn't finish it: Ugh. This might have been a good book if it were half the size, but Conrad strains to keep the plot going amid the endless descriptions of sea, sky, and the characters' states of mind. Move along, move along! This ancient icon may be a monument to Conrad's mastery of his second language, and it may be a tragic psychological exploration of the universal heroic destiny (or something equally dense), but listening to it doesn't exactly keep you on the edge of your seat.
__label__2 A great work of art: This book works on so many levels, it's mind boggling...it's an adventure story, it's a philosophical novel of ideas, it's got brilliant use of language. Like a painter, Conrad creates effects by deciding what to put in and what to leave out; he shifts narrators and fractures the time sequence to get maximum impact from his story. If you don't get it the first time, try again (I've read it many, many times). It's pure poetry and a genuinely profound book. The review below from VA that describes Conrad's theme (facing your fears) is totally right on the money -- so face your fears about reading a difficult book, buy a copy of Lord Jim and read it, and you'll be a better person for the experience.
__label__2 exquisite: how many of us read NIGHT FLIGHT in high school as quickly as possible? my grown experience of Saint-Exupery is the opposite. i linger over every page. Saint-Exupery provides a literary meal to be savored page by page. call me an escapist but the skies over Buenos Aires never looked so good.
__label__1 Long Winded, Sand and Stars: There's one good chapter, a good story, about survival. Otherwise, the pretentious Frenchman force feeds the reader his personal philosophy through a superfluous writing style. His name matches his style, long-winded and pretentious.
__label__1 WHY???: I was definitely turned on by all of the hype before the movie. The commercial previews left me with much anticipation....LL, Jada, Vivica Fox, Whoopi!!! I couldn't wait! Then I saw the movie..........What happened? How could they have all of those folks in there and have that movie turn out that way? All I can really say is that I was truly disappointed and I don't know who was at fault. I've seen all of these people in other productions, so I know they can act....was it the director? the producer? Now here's a good question, Toni Braxton WAS in the movie, right? So why in the world would they have Jada up there acting like she was singing?????? I can't go on.............
__label__1 Looks and feels too cheap to give as a gift: I bought this for my brother for his birthday but I had to return it because I was to embarrassed to give it to him. The dice have rounded edges so you can't use them for gambling. The cards are very cheap so you would also swap those out for your own. Basically you buy this just for the travel case and the chips. Well, the case I received was rusted. yes, a brand new case, out of the box, had rust on the handle and the closure buckles. I returned it.
__label__1 Must be made in China: I purchased this for my step-daughter who is a poker novice. I thought she would like to have her own poker set to play and practice. One week after receiving it, she informed me that the set already began falling apart. The hinge came off and it's literally falling apart on her.This was embarrassing because it was a gift from me. Now I must redeem myself and purchase a better set. Do not buy this piece of junk.
__label__1 Cute But Poor Quality: These are charming little espresso cups but they do not hold heat for more than 2 or 3 minutes. Granted, we live in a cold climate, so our house is usually cool, but one ought not have to drink a cup of espresso in 3 minutes before it cools off. Also the cup itself gets quite hot if one happens to touch it while using the handle. Best to give to your daughter for a toy.
__label__2 This book is thorough but poorly written.: It is ironic that an account of the Steely Dan phenomenon is documented by someone whose writing skills are negligable. Becker and Fagen, two contemporary literary masters by most standards, would find it strangely fitting, I suppose. Sweet's saving grace is his penchant for detail. His tome has the stories for which every avid Dan fan hungers. Recording sessions, writing sessions, band reformulations, personal melodramas, etc. These elements make it enjoyable reading, especially when accompanied by revisitations to the legendary recordings. Listening to the CD's while making one's chronological journey through this book, is distictly thrilling, as well as eye(ear)-opening. The lack of an index and of footnotes limits this volume's usefulness as a reference source however. It would be nice to see a similar effort made by a writer who posesses a similar creative energy, quirkiness and skill to that of Becker and Fagen themselves.
__label__1 Re-Releasing "An Evening With John Denver" under a different title!: If you already own "An Evening with John Denver" (five star album) then you don't need this one! The same program (exactly) has been repackaged with a new title and cover...less the two best songs! "Boy From The Country" and "Today"...the original is fabulous but why do it again?!?!?
__label__2 Bang Bang Kiss Kiss: This album is great to listen to if you want to hear the begining of glassjaw. But this is just the tip of the ice berg. Demos go way back to Impossible Shot, Don Fury and Monster Zero. If you want to hear an even earlier inception of GlassJAw be sure to check out Sons of Abraham's album "Termites in His Smile" which is Jewish Hardcore. KKBB was ORIGINALLY released before EYEWTKAS so it has a different sound. But like every release glassjaw has put out, each one sounds different from the previous. Everyone into glassjaw should get this album, although the price listed on here is redic!! one should check out merchdirect.
__label__1 No idea about this album: I ordered this album, but it never came. Beware of third party sellers, because they can be shifty. I certainly wish I could give you a review of this album, but unfortunately I NEVER GOT IT!!
__label__2 prattgirl: I normally don't go for mushy romance type books...I am more of a fan of Patterson's other material, but this book was great. It was a quick read, which once I started, I couldn't put it down. Everytime I got my eyes dried and cheered up, bam- he hit me with something new and I was crying again. Patterson has outdone himself yet again.
__label__2 Letters of the Past: I thoroughly enjoyed Sam's letters to Jennifer! I am an avid James Patterson Fan (especially of the Alex Cross Series) and to read something different like this from Mr. Patterson, I wasn't sure I was going to enjoy as much. However I have come to realize that to be a GREAT Author, you need to show some diversity. Well Mr. Patterson certainly shows that in this book. Its well written, a quick read and very emotional! I loved it!The book is about Sam (the grandmother), Jennifer (the grand-daughter) and Brendan (the lost love). Sam had left letters for Jennifer to read that showed that Sam's life wasn't at all as picture perfect as people may have believe it to be. It showed Sam's unhappiness with her husband and her new found love in another man. Upon coping with her own life in the big city, and now coping with Sam and then Brendan, we see how strong Jennifer is and how much her love for her grandmother, will get her through.
__label__2 Great Story, Patterson Does It Again: Sam's Letters to Jennifer is one of those stories where you laugh, you cry, you make a fool of yourself. Jennifer is probably one of Patterson's most likable characters. Even though, there were times when the book kind of reminded me of Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas (very few), I was pleasantly suprised. It has a very happy and at the same time very heartbreaking ending. Their is a great mystery and it keeps you guessing until the very end. All in all it is very vintage Patterson. Fast paced and great story.
__label__1 YUCK!: Has James Patterson sunk so low that he's now penning drivel just for the money? Every 1-star reviewer of this book is right on, so I won't repeat their critiques. Every 4- and 5-star reviewer must have read a different book! I am angry that Mr. Patterson holds his loyal fans in such low esteem that he'd allow so shallow and boring a book to come to market. I am angry that his publisher was so greedy to do it! Like so many other bestselling authors, Patterson seems to have lost his touch, even in his mystery series. A smart author should know when to say when, and if he doesn't, then I do - WHEN! If he continues to write this kind of garbage, I will no longer read it.
__label__1 Pathetic Dialogue: I don't understand why people adore Patterson. His lame dialogue is beyond tedious. This one could have been written by a teenager.
__label__1 This is Og Mandino at his worst: This is a fast read, which continues to remind us that we should appreciate each day and those around us. Yes we should but I don't understand why Mr. Patterson wants to venture out of the genre that he excels in...mystery novels.
__label__1 absolute treacle: It's amazing that a book this bad could have been published. It consists of one maudlin cliche after another. The widowed Jennifer, who miscarried her dead husband's child, has to deal with her beloved grandmother having a stroke. She meets someone who could be "the one" for her, but -- oops! -- he has a brain tumor and is likely to die. The writing is amateurish, full of telling instead of showing. The only reason I finished it was because I was trapped on vacation in a cabin with nothing else to read.
__label__1 Majorly sucked: This book was jam-packed with cliches and wooden characters and dialogue. At 236 very small pages with a bigger font than necessary, this novel was probably more like 150 real pages long. It also seemed to be written for, oh, I don't know - a ten year old maybe. The writing seemed to be geared to a fourth grade level. All I can hope for now is that it doesn't get made into a load-of-crap TV movie.
__label__1 Just like Suzanne's Diary...: I really liked Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas, so I thought I'd check this out. I didn't think it was worth my time. The books seemed exactly alike - especially the tone of the character's writing style (Suzanne vs. Sam). It seemed clear that since Suzanne's Diary did so well, the author decided to write a book exactly like it. It was an incredibly predictable love story.
__label__1 Tear Up the Formula: I am a fan of Mr Patterson's books, but this one was very disapointing. It was like he sat down and wrote up a list of "what will make women cry" and then put every single thing in the book. It is overdone to the point of you can not connect to the characters because the tragedy's that happen to them are too much and in a manner that is not realistic to everyday life. Mr Patterson needed to think instead of what will make a woman cry but what will make a good story not a formulated story. This book tried to force the reader to be emotional and instead makes you feel annoyed at the characters and the story.
__label__1 Some of the worst writing I have ever read!: This author needs to stick to his normal genre. This was a good idea for a story line, but I felt like a 14 year old wrote it! I have read most of his other books and have enjoyed them, but I had to force myself to finish this one.
__label__1 NOT the originals: While the sound quality on these disks is excellent, be aware that app. 50% of the tunes are not the originals. Shout Factory should be ashamed, duping customers like this. Rhino Records would never pull such a stunt. Go for the 4-disk Rhino box set (Vol. One) instead. You can find many high quality used versions for sale all over the web, too.
__label__2 The Only Doo-Wop collection you'll ever need: This is a fantastic overall collection of Doo-Wop groups/songs i have heard.This covers most of the variations of songs let alone the big hits of the day many years back
__label__1 disappointing: I was hoping the songs were the original recordings by the original artists. Little Darlin is not the hit recording by the Diamonds. I don't know which group is singing but it's the wrong one. Disappointing.
__label__1 Complete waste of time: I think this is the worst remake of any movie of all time. What a piece of garbage. Can't come close to original.
__label__2 show the entire movie: Currently, the movie start with Barbara and her brother enroute to the graveyard. However years ago, the movie started with the introduction of the first, the one zombie walking through the graveyard. He was introduced as the murderer of a little girl and it showed his trial, execution and then him rising from his coffin killing the burial detail before he heads in Barbara's direction. I don't know why they edited this part out. It gave the movie a little more substance., ,
__label__1 really BAD Sony transfer.: Saw a friend's copy of this and the difference between the DVD and this bluray is like night and day - pun intended - someone over at Sony when transferring this disc made the entire movie so utterly dark - it renders the disc nearly unwatchable. Granted the film is supposed to take place at night, the new transfer is quite frankly awful.
__label__1 Lol...Filth: My absolute FAVORITE horror movie of ALL time is "Night of the Living Dead"...The 1968, black/white, low budget version. I started watching the 1990 version 'Sci-Fi' one afternoon, and I didn't stop watching it until it was over...Why? It was hilarious...Plus they had a better zombie movie on afterwards, and I didn't have anything else to do until then... This movie is despicable compared to the original. From terrible dialogue to terrible themes, this movie is just TERRIBLE... If you haven't seen the 1968 version, with all enthusiasm from myself, please watch it a.s.a.p., but never subject yourself to the remake unless you're either punishing yourself, or you need a good laugh...
__label__1 Garbage: Never buy this; it worked about 1 week. I will never buy that again. I can't find another similar pump yet.
__label__1 Not for everyone: If your main objective, is the study of human relationships,social rapports between humans, and conquering and seducing otherpeople, this movie is for you.Not an embarrassing movie, at all, for any of the actors. Just,a nutty story, and enfatuation of the author of the script withpeople, relationships, seduction, etc.This is not to say that the above aspects are unimportant. Not true.Just that, perhaps a movie about such a theme might be more funfor some people than others.
__label__2 Sweet and funny, though completely predictable: This movie is not going to shock you with it's ending or offer you a new twist on the same old romcoms of the past. It is a quintessential romcom, but it's so very worth your time. It's very funny; I like all the actors in it, and it's just a fun, light-hearted movie.
__label__2 Adorable Fun Movie, Great Cast!: Love this film. It's a classic. Ashley Judd & Hugh Jackman are fantastic! Greg Kinnear is also great in this film., love it, love it!
__label__2 Sweet Little Movie: I know that this movie got "mixed reviews," whatever that means, but I found it charming and sweet and rather touching at some parts. I enjoyed the DVD for all the extras, too. I loved listening to Hugh Jackman with a different accent than his native Australian, and the oh so proper English accent he used in that other romantic movie he was recently in."Someone. . ." touches on so many emotions, and Ashley Judd is funny and manic, and her comic timing is great. I am very happy that I bought this movie. Don't miss the cheerleader scene. Hugh Jackman was gorgeous.
__label__2 Hugh Jackman is scrumptous!!! ;): I actually bought this movie having never seen it. I saw Greg Kinnear on the box and read the blurb on the back and decided it was cheaper to buy it than to rent it. I absolutely fell in love with Hugh Jackman. Ashley Judd is always adorable in romantic comedies. Greg Kinnear is never bad in his roles,(but he sometimes picks horrid roles). The premise is cute and as romantic comedies go it wasn't horrible but it was rather predictable. What made me give it 4 stars is the fact that Hugh Jackman was absolutely delightful as the bad boy casanova. What took Hollywood so long to find him?
__label__1 Not the best....: The print is great but can not find more than half of the answers for my puzzles... Tried over and over and the book is one big failure...
__label__2 For light comic romantic entertainment, it's a winner...: Michael J. Fox, David Ogden Stiers, Woody Harrelson and all the supporting cast members are wonderful in this small, quiet story of a stranded doctor in a seemingly stagnant southern town. It's not a masterpiece, not an award winner, not an enduring example of its genre, but it is fun, and it is sweet, and it offers a nice escape from the troubles of the day. For decent folks, it's a very decent 90-minutes of movie magic.
__label__1 Scanned from VHS?: This DVD has a very poor transcription of the original. It's either been poorly scanned from a very dirty print of the 16mm film version, or scanned from the VHS. I suspect the latter as the colors are washed out, and the film shows the 'Do not pirate this video tape' warning after the film. I might even be tempted to think this has not been produced by the studio as the DVD menu looks like it was made in iDVD on a Mac.The only plus side is that the film is the full content, including the scenes that are omitted from the TV broadcast version.
__label__1 duped: I thought I was purchasing the special edition of Pinocchio--at least, that was the picture of the dvd that was on the website. What I got was a Korean version. I got my money back.
__label__2 Pinocchio (Disney Gold Classic Collection): Via Amazon - Excellent service, prompt delivery, excellent conditionas described, packaged well.Would use again.
__label__1 no extra features!: I would review the movie just the DVD! First of all there are no making of, storyboard,production notes or any extra features ! The only extra feature you get with this DVD is the trailer! Oh, did I mention that the DVD has beautiful picture on it! Rent it first ,then buy at Disney outragous price that they want for this DVD! Just watch later on Disney will reissue it (and the others in their collection with all the extras this DVD lack! If you want those extra features stick with the studios Disney owns! They are Miramax,Dimension,Hollywood Pictures,Touchstones Pictures,ABC network,Anchor Bay and Walt Disney Pictures! I hope this info helps others looking for disney movies other than the animated movies!
__label__1 Very Dissapointed: I purchased this movie for my son(6yrs) and the add stated that the DVD was in excellant shape. We played it once and noticed some sound problems but when went to play this again the sound was horrible. I sent an email to Amazon and received no response. I would like to get a replacement but I do not know how to go about this as I no longer have any information on the person who actually sent it to me.For the most part I have had good luck buying from Amazon but this was a terrible purchase and we are very dissapointed.
__label__1 Pinocchio not the only one who lies!: This version of Pinocchio was in Italian! No where in the discription does this item indicate that it is the Italian version! Now I have to send it back to Italy for a refund...
__label__2 It's a classic !!: How can you not love the classic version of Disney's Pinocchio. The platinum edition has a bunch of extras and enhanced quality. It felt like I was 8years old again, and watching it in the movie theater. A must buy for any Disney animation fan.
__label__1 This movie was such a bad movie!: I've always hated this movie, not due to it's "violent and disturbing content" but because of it's bad acting and pure stupidity. This movie is a children's movie, anyone who complains that it's too scary and violent for kids is out of thier minds and are being way too uptight ( people like this are the reason why anime is so butchered when it comes to the States!). But that's not what I'm here to talk about, I'm here to talk about how bad this movie is. It's voice actors aren't that good, the wooden boy has equally wooden acting, and the ending of the movie made no sense whatsoever! Come on Disney! Explain to me why Pinoccio suddenly drowns at the end of the movie when earlier on the was walking at the botton of the ocean talking to the fish without any indication that he needs air to live in the first place?! It was just plain stupid, a move to make the viewers feel bad for the little hero, when his death makes no sense!
__label__2 Pinocchio 2 Disc Anniversary Edition: This movie is a classic and one that I enjoyed as a child growing up. The xtras on this set make it even more endearing for young and old alike.
__label__2 love it: Bought this for my mother. Fast shipping, the DVD was not in the original shrink wrap but the DVD was sealed. No problems with the DVD itself it played well.
__label__2 BD-live features mostly worthless: I explored the BD-live feature for the first time last night, and most of the functions require registration on Disney's site. On Disney's site an FAQ asserts that those features are being discontinued, and account creation is no longer possible. WTH? This disc was only released 8 months ago, and the much-heralded BD-Live features that personalize your disc and experience are already outdated.For what it's worth, I just bought UP (released last week), and the BD-Live features from Disney appear to be nothing but downloading trailers for other films ... four of them. My verdict on Disney BD-Live => total waste of time.
__label__1 Not very good: I actually ordered two dirtbags and within a week, they were both leaking dirt. So I went and ordered beed hacky sacks and now I'm happy. Did not like the dirtbags at all.
__label__2 The Fundamentals of Math AND Philosophy: For anyone looking for an introduction to math, geometry more specifically, or philosophy at large, this is THE book, and in my estimation, THE edition to get. Heath is no fly-by-night pop-philosopher. His notes are almost as worthwhile as the text itself... a truly monumental feat.The rigors of geometry, the method of logic learned in these proofs, are one of the best ways to prepare the mind for real philosophy. Anyone can talk about the true and the good in a manner that inspires awe through vagueness and transcendent language, but that is a very different matter than the sort of philosophy that is built upon the real work of logic and hard-earned definitions.If you have any interest in the latter, I heartily commend this book to you.
__label__2 Love it!!: I Love this Toque! I work in a milk refrigerator and wear it in there all the time. Supper thick and comfy.
__label__2 Vote For Stillson!...: What a movie! What a cast! David Cronenberg took King's classic tale of precognition and predestination and gave it his own personal bleak touch! Christopher Walken (Sleepy Hollow) is the perfect Johnny Smith, taken out of normality and plunged into a psychic nightmare world. His gift / curse enables him to see both past and future events, leading him ever closer to his final destiny. Martin Sheen (The Little Girl Who Lives Down The Lane) is excellent as the lizard-like senate candidate, Greg Stillson. Horror mistress, Brooke Adams (Invasion Of The Body Snatchers, Shock Waves, Sometimes They Come Back) is Johnny's could / should-have-been "wife", unable to shake Johnny from her mind. Tom Skerritt (Alien) is the sheriff of Castlerock who seeks out Johnny in order to catch the infamous Castlerock killer. Herbert Lom (Asylum) is Johnny's doctor. Even Anthony Zerbe (The Omega Man) and Colleen Dewhurst (When A Stranger Calls) are along for this wild ride! Highly recommended...
__label__2 Good movie: Not much to say. Good story, Christopher Walken is awesome, great ending, not too much gore.Four more words are required...
__label__2 Very pertinent to how we raise our sons in this society.: Very pertinent to how we raise our sons in our society. A must read by ever parent while their son is growing up. If you like this book, try Go West Old Man by Max Barnet, a true tale about a father/son trip across the country in a pickup truck, discovering each other, including their needs. A clash of generations resolving.
__label__1 Predictable: The book may be good for people whom have little understanding of children in general. Of course boys have emotions and ofcourse they are trained not to express those. It's up to the parents to ensure that boys learn to express their emotions. I wish the book had had practical examples of how to do it, instead of stories of angry, sad boys.
__label__2 The classic analysis on the internal life of boys: I read most every book on this subject since I am a therapist and a parent.This is a great place to start.It might not be the most readable book but, nonetheless, is worth buying.
__label__2 A Family Comedy That Is Out Of This World.: Suburban Commando is a 1991 sci-fi action/comedy family film which stars WWE Legend Hollywood Hulk Hogan, Christopher Lloyd and Shelley Duvall. In this film Hogan portrays Shep Ramsey, a gruff and cynical intergalatic bounty hunter who, after a botched rescue mission, travels to Earth for rest and relaxation. There, Ramsey begrudgingly makes friends with a couple(Lloyd and Duvall)and their two kids. While on Earth, Shep comically learning the Earth cultures and customs. Suburban Commando also has an appearance by WWE wresling star The Undertaker, as one of Ramsey's arch-villains. The special feature includes a trailer of the movie and trailers for New Line's other family films. This film is perfect for kids, parents and wrestling fans of all ages.
__label__2 Great Flick!: Loved it in the 80's, story and humor sill holds up! Kevin Bacon young and energetic. Great fun!Spawned sequels which don't hold a candle to this original.
__label__2 funny and a little scary: We watched this again after many years. It is still just as funny! Kevin Bacon is great. I love Reba in it too.
__label__2 Good Entetainment: Just a fun movie. Never made it big in the movies but an enjoyaable experience overall. Some swearing but it fits -- not just for the sake of using the F word which, incidentally, is never used.
__label__2 Awesome Picture!!!: Now this is what High Definition is all about.I was very Pleased with the "Picture Quality" on the "Tremors" HD DVD.The image makes you think you are watching a 2007 movie release.The picture is awesome.
__label__2 Don't walk across the football pitch in the dark...: This movie is in my personal top 10 - which just shows how much I enjoyed it. It may not be art, but by gum, it's cracking good fun. The comedy is suitably black and nasty, the tension is very palpable, and the concept - well, the concept may not be absolutely original (what is, these days?) but it is very good. I think very highly of it as an example of how good a horror movie should be, ironic, intelligent, sassy, smart and well-acted. The monsters are JUST this side of credible, which makes it all the more riveting. Last night, I was walking across three deserted football pitches on campus and suddenly remembered this movie - and had to keep reminding myself that it was JUST a movie. That is the sign of a successful "beast" horror movie. It relies upon common sense, a humourous screenplay, actors who do not ham any more than is necessary, and a general atmosphere of cracking good fun. Brilliant stuff.
__label__1 Quite possible the worst movie of all times. 0 stars: This movie [stinks]. The story is nothing like the original, the acting is horrific, the swordfighting utterly ridiculous.The scene that sums it all up is when the guards won't chase after a carriage going about 1 mph and everyone escapes.I have no idea how on earth anyone could make a movie so terrible. Extremely torturous to watch. Do not buy it, do not rent it. In fact, just read the book, which is awesome.
__label__1 Laurel & Hardy Perils: The Further Perils of Laurel and HardyI received this item this week(March 7 2008) & it was one I did not know was avalable & saw thru a link. I have the other items in this Youngson series from other publishers late last year. This one is poor to, say the least, with faded & washed-out images although the sound is OK. The grain is very high and contrary to another review, PAL TV in Australia in the 1950s & 60s did not look anything as bad as the images in this DVD. The other Youngsons that came out last year were better although the highest priced one did leave a lot to be desired in picture quality also but not like the Further Perils. If only Warner bros would buy more of these things for extras on their great DVD releases then we would have restoration similar to what they have provided on at least one L&H; DVD set. But to have this title in the collection gets us to more completion of the Youngson compilations on DVD.
__label__1 Received a used set: Nothing fundamentally wrong with it, but the manufacturer's original box had been opened before and rather clumsily taped back together, and the "aluminum" case is covered in small scratches and dents. I don't have the time to return the set for replacement since it was bought as a gift for an upcoming occasion. Disappointing.
__label__1 A disappointment!: Having made the change to Veganism recently, and discovering Seitan, I was expecting this cookbook to open the door to non-meat Paradise! The description of the book, and the reviews of others made it sound like the Holy Grail.Bah.I'd say 40-50% of the recipes using the prepared Seitan call for the "wheat-meat" to be battered and deep fried. So WHERE is the healthy cooking in THAT? I was looking for recipes for the actual Seitan preparation, using different seasonings and flavors, and then hoping to find a fake meatloaf recipe, or a fake turkey and stuffing for Thanksgiving.I'm still looking.
__label__2 Seitan Quickly: Cookbook on Cooking with Seitan was in excellent condition and arrived very promptly. The book itself wasn't all I had hoped--too many weird ingredients that I can't begin to find--but that is NOT the fault of Amazon or the bookseller who sent the order.
__label__1 Damaged goods: While my sister was extremely excited about the glasses I got her has a gift, one arrived broken. When I called customer service to replace the broken glass I was notified that Amazon would not replace the damaged item. I could get a full refund, but they would not send a replacement. I was appalled. What business refuses to replace damaged items? You can guarantee I won't be buying anything being shipped through Amazon anymore. I will buy directly from the seller.
__label__1 Screens wore out quickly: The screens on this product wore out very quickly and are $20 to replace which is almost the cost of the entire product at $35. Everything else seems fine.
__label__1 Very disappointed: This is a set book for the University course I'm following. To be honest, I've not read it all. I've read the introductory chapter and picked at the rest of the book.I'm disappointed that other reviewers suggest that this book is well written and academic. It's a rambling incoherent mess of ideas that proposes large-scale state censorship/'perception control' and as such has no place in universities which should protect the ideals of academic freedom and free speech. The net is not considered as a political forum, rather there is a heavy authoritarianism.I'm very disappointed with it.
__label__1 Not her best: I love Virginia Henley but these characters are so disconnected and unromantic. There is simply nothing endearing about any of the players in this book, in fact most of all the characters are so flawed and dark I hate to consider it a romance. Definately put this on your "if there is nothing else to read" list.
__label__1 insipid: this book and others like it so insult the intelligence of anyone with half a brain. Read something substantial for a change!
__label__2 A CD you can listen to over and over...: I'd never heard of James Tipper until I heard about this CD on a newsgroup. I rarely buy CD's based on one song but I did this time and was very suprised. It has lots of different styles and moods so you don't get tired of one vibe like you do with alot of CD's. There's something for everyone. I like the techno sounding stuff like Bioluminescence and Evolve and the title track and my wife likes the ballads that are done mostly with piano. Lyrics are great and there are clever production touches. Overall, money well spent.
__label__1 Neighbor's Dog Liked it More than I thought...: I got this product to keep my neighbor's pesky dog out of my goddamned garden!I coated some of my seeds with this stuff before I planted a recent carrot patch. As expected, the dog came and ate all of the carrots. I expected him to get sick or at least no longer enjoy the carrots due to their Uranium nature, but he loved it! He continued to eat the carrots, visibly growing as he ate them. He left my garden at least 6 inches taller and with a spryness I have never seen out of the damn old mutt. I watched this scene from my window with horror and I still am not sure what to do about this. At night I can see a faint green glow coming from the neighbor's doghouse which I assume is a result of my carrot shenanigans.I only gave this product 2 starts because it grew, overnight, the largest carrots I have ever seen. They were 2' long and a vibrant orange that I have never seen before.
__label__1 Do not buy...: Bought this for a weather experiment. Could only produce 1.19 gigawatts, had to seek out another source that was very unpleasant to work with.
__label__2 Excellent Fuel for Robot Army: As a busy mad scientist with many voices distracting me on a nearly constant basis, it is helpful to find such a wonderful product that I can use on on a daily basis. Whether as fuel for my robot army (coming soon to a neighborhood near you) or as a catalyst for mutation or just as a healthy snack, this product continues to amaze. My wife/captive swears by it and uses a pinch in her morning coffee. She is literally glowing from the inside out because this product. Highly recommended!
__label__1 Need a lawyer or an act of Congress !!!!: After the 200 jars of your uranium ore arrived at my home. A heavily armed S.W.A.T team tossed in a few tear gas canisters and broke down my front door. Thankfully, they have WIFI here at Guantanamo. I hear my wife will be getting out of the hospital soon and my kitty kat will be fetching tear gas canisters in heaven now. All of my new friends don't speak a word of english but the weather is nice here. Thanks Amazon.com and thank you Department of Homeland Security!
__label__2 Thank you Jewish Physics: My son is only 6'2 and if he wishes to be an NFL QB, well then, mutation is the best possible avenue now that human growth hormone is banned. I put this stuff on his cereal in the AM and now after a month he stands at 8'1. Can you say signing bonus?
__label__1 Can of cancer: I got some of this stuff to cover myself with during Halloween. I thought it would be cool to walk around glow in the dark.Instead the day before Christmas I got diagnosed for cancer of everything and I've got [...] less for chemotherapy treatments (great, more radiation) since I can't return this can of death.On a happy note, my wife just found out she was pregnant. I hope our kid doesn't have two heads and ten arms. Well, if the baby does maybe we can send it to India where it will be worshiped as a god.
__label__1 NOT ENOUGH!: It did little more than power a death star, so I returned it to the Earth forces... DO NOT BUY!
__label__1 WARNING: DO NOT EAT: Oratory ingestion is not recommended. I decided to eat some of my Uranium last week and experienced some unwanted side-effects. I now go by the name General Zorg AND YOU SHALL BOW DOWN TO ME AND MY MUTANT POWERS!!!
__label__2 Do Not own yet, but will in near future...: I am waiting for my full body hazmat protection suit to come in the mail. Afterwards I will order this unit. Great price!
__label__2 I like it. I love it! I want some more of it!!: Yeah, give it to me, baby. Give me some more! What a tasty little movie!Now, let me be serious. This movie is delicious! Gibson and Hunt are both terrific. Have you seen Braveheart? Well, that movie is only good because of Mel Gibson. What Women Want is good and funny for the same reason. Maybe Helen Hunt had a little to do with that, but Gibson alone is sufficient for a movie's goodness and funniness. Basically, Gibson and hunt made this movie work; the screenwriter and director and everyone other than Gibson and Hunt had nothing to do with it.
__label__1 Distaff.: Rather pretentious comedy featuring Mel Gibson, who, despite all the emasculation, is in bumpy, toothy, silly-little-boy mode. What women want, indeed! He's a Don Juan in the advertising world, who gets zapped by his blow-dryer while drinking some interesting-looking Cabernet. The result? He's given the ability to read women's thoughts. This is distressing, at first. Regressive, too: according to the writers (all women), these Turn-Of-The-Millennium-I'm-Every-Woman women primarily want to feast their eyes on Mel's tooshy. Hear me ROAR! Well, our hero soon learns to use his newfound Superpowers for his own profit, but then . . . ah, but then, the movie suddenly gets very serious. Most of the second act is dull. The movie finally wears out its welcome starting with about the last 15 minutes. Rent only if you want to annoy your boyfriend . . . which is REALLY What Women Want! (Kidding, kidding -- sheesh)
__label__1 *GAG* - Not another sugar-coated chick flick!!: This movie proves that Hell is full and the dead are walking the Earth, making these movies and sitting in theatres watching them. The old "all men are scum until they get in touch with their feelings" plot is dredged up again in this lamebrain film. I guess I was supposed to get all doe-eyed and say "Is'nt Mel dreamy?" and laugh at the supposed "Comedy" while watching this flick, but it made me wretch! Boring, silly and a waste of time.What do men want? Our money back!
__label__1 predictable: predictable hollywood flick. not horrible if you've just eaten too much, it's 1 in the morning, and you need something to zone out with. aside from that scenario, not worth the time.
__label__1 I hope not.: Rather pretentious comedy featuring Mel Gibson, who, despite all the emasculation, is in bumpy, toothy, silly-little-boy mode. What women want, indeed! He's a Don Juan in the advertising world, who gets zapped by his blow-dryer while drinking some interesting-looking Cabernet. The result? He's given the ability to read women's thoughts.

__label__2 EXCELLENT: This Cd of Daft Punk is unbelievable. If you wanna hear rythmic sounds without profanity, threats or abuse of women, excellent tunes, great dance or work out music.
__label__2 good overall toy: this is a very fun boat overall. it isn't very fast, but it has great range and it's batteries last a long time. the only problem with the battery system is that it takes 6 AA batteries and u keep having to get new ones. I also recommend bringing it to a place with no waves so the boat doesn't tip. Overall, this is a very good boat for its price and especially good for younger children.
__label__1 There are none so blind then those who refuse to see!: Yes Mrs Pulling has done her best to caution others about "breaking with reality", and her book serves as an adequate example of what can happen when someone does become reality impared; it contains no real facts to support her claims that Dungeons and Drangons had any thing to do with any deaths what so ever, and what "facts" she does offer are either falsely described or out right lies. I agree that if you are a bad parent you should probably error on the side of caution and limit the activities of your little monster, but I think "not keeping guns in the house" and "not letting your child butcher pets" (both things Mrs Pulling admits she or her son did) should come well before stopping them from playing D&D. Besides if you get rid of D&D who will you blame when they finally do kill someone?
__label__2 Wow!: We had heard about this item (and the many similar items) and decideded that we'd give it a try. Wow! We had no idea how fantastic it would be...or would continue to be...and continue to be...The design is great. The controls work. It's a fantastic piece of equipment. The only complaint is that it's not silent, but we don't think that would matter under the circumstances - we weren't either.
__label__2 Elvis review: If you bought this you proably already like Elvis music. This cd is worth the money. Many of my favorite Elvis songs were in his movies and never released as singles or for that matter hits. This is a great way for me to hear them again.
__label__2 Excellent edition of the book: This is an excellent edition of the book, it even includes a small timeline biography of Alexandre Dumas which was very insightful. Overall no complaints with this product at all.
__label__2 The Count of Monte Cristo by Alexandre Dumas (kindle): All I can say is AMAZING. This novel is incredible. The subtle and deliciously wicked scenarios that Edmund Dantes orchestrates to exact his revenge on his enemies are awe-inspiring and SOOOO entertaining. Although the 2002 Jim Caviezel movie is a great stand-alone film, it reveals so little of the subplots and supporting characters that you can dive into the book as if it's a brand new story and it really doesn't ruin either one. Please keep in mind that it IS a 19th century novel, so you'll have to wade through some serious romantic protestations, but they do not take away from the action. Definately worth reading...and FREE on Kindle. Thank you Kindle!
__label__2 This is the Muhammad Ali of books, The Greatest of all time.: Dumas is the greatest story teller ever, and this is his finest work. If you love adventure, great yarns or being captivated by excellence, read this book.
__label__2 Worth a second read.: I read and enjoyed this book as a youth. Later I read some of the Three Musketeers, was bored, and thought maybe Dumas had been a taste of adolescence. But the second time around, I found this story still a great read. Monte Cristo is not a study in psychology or culture: it is an amusement park ride before Disney, an Indiana Jones film in ink: a heck of a way to spend a rainy afternoon. (And make sure your plans for the evening are flexible.)The version I bought, Bantom, was too skinny, however. (Thus the missing star, also for typos.) Life is too short to read half of a masterpiece. Subvert the culture of instant gratification, and buy the unabridged version. Same goes for Hugo's Les Miserables, a similar bit of 19th Century French romanticism, even more rambling and magnificent in its un-cut version.
__label__2 Kinda wish I had read the longer one!: This is BY FAR, the best book I have EVER read! I HATE reading, and I read this 450 page book in three days! It was for summer reading for school, and I thought that I would read it before i saw the movie coming out soon! I AM SO GLAD I DID!! Thanks!
__label__1 Poor Quality: Let me be clear that I am a big fan of The Count of Monte Cristo, but don't spend your money on this copy. Visually, it's unappealing to the eyes (looks like a phone book). What is far worse, though, is that the editing in this book is horrendous. I will be half way through a sentence and the other half of it is starting a completely knew paragraph. There are spelling errors throughout the text. And what is really annoying is that the table of contents' page numbers don't match up with the text's page numbers. There's about a 50 page difference between the two. How that happened, I don't know. But, let me tell you that there are better unabridged copies of this excellent book out there.
__label__2 The Count of Monte Cristo: I first read this wonderful novel in high school. Interestingly, I read this book by personal selection and not by a Literature assignment. I remember it as the first book I loved. I am a voracious reader of reviews on Amazon and other sources. A recent review of this book reminded me that I should read it again. I'm enjoying it as much now as I did then.
__label__2 The Count of Monte Cristo: Although Count of Monte Cristo kept me on my toes wondering what would happen next, it seemed to drone on by without a certain explanation. I loved the book, it just had parts that i thought Dumas could have easily done without. Besides that, Count of Monte Cristo was a wonderfully written book that deserves full credit on itself. It had such passion and devotion inside it; it's as though Dumas himself was feeling the same imprisonment as Dantes.
__label__2 The Count of Monte Cristo (Oxford world Classics): Thoroughly entertaining and timeless read. Makes one reflect strongly on the emotions and ups and down of life. I wish I had realized the cross references were present at the end of the book as it may have clarified a few things. All in all I found it to be a book that I did not want to put down. I read reviews that recommended the unabridged versions and I am glad that I read it.
__label__2 Superb, but definitely a product of its time: Judging by the reviews here, criticizing this book is like criticizing Shakespeare -- anything less than full throated praise is dismissed. Let me be clear: I loved this book and it was well worth the time it took to read. It is deservedly considered a timeless classic.Nevertheless, it definitely has a pace that is not seen in modern books. If this had been created by a contemporary writer it would probably be about 25% shorter. I'm not saying that would make it better, it would simply make it a book created for modern sensibilities.If you like fast-paced modern writing, you will definitely need to recalibrate your expectations. Once you accept this book on its own terms, it is a very rewarding read.
__label__1 Terrible, terrible edition: A wonderful classic story butchered by a senseless editor who removed major portions of the story without letting the reader know. The description on the back cover misleads the consumer into thinking that one is getting so much more than the full text (the edition includes a brief introduction of the author, critical analysis and explanatory notes). I'd rather do without the side commentary and get the full original manuscript. The problem isn't that the editor decided to abridge the book, but that they chose to conceal this fact from the reader.The removed portions are integral to the storyline and I was left baffled by how disjointed the novel seemed, so uncharacteristic of Alexandre Dumas. Then I found out it's not the author's fault.Book is highly recommended, but I would also recommend that readers invest in more trustworthy versions out there.
__label__2 Excellent: Old world type thriller. Definitely better than the movie. Talk about revenge being best served cold. This is the epitomy of that.
__label__1 Abridged version, buyer beware.: This is the abridged version of the Dumas classic.Having not read the original yet, I can only compare itto The Three Musketeers. Dumas' writing style losesenergy in the abridging process. The reader ought tobe aware that the story has been simplified and summarized.If you want the true flavor of Dumas, order the unabridgedversion.
__label__1 Horrible: Don't waste your time reading this edition. There are many grammatical errors in this edition. Terrible formatting will not let you get pleasure from reading this book.
__label__2 Great story of redemption: Sweet revenge at it's finest.Love, romance, long friendship gone wrong.It's all in here. Not like the movie, so don't beterribly disappointed.
__label__1 Thumbs down: The first time I watched these years agoI liked them. Today they seem a little outdated??Just did not enjoy them really. Thumbs down.
__label__2 breath of fresh air: For the Love of Children, is filled with wonderful stories and quotes that will let any parent at any phase of parenting know that they are not alone.It is delightful to hear other people give voice to my parenting challenges, such as Robert Frost's statement about a father and mother toward son and daughter. One of the best quotes, "If you don't want your children to hear what you're saying, . . . . pg 27
__label__2 This book would make a great Mother's day gift!: This book was given to me. I read it and placed it on my book shelf. As a writer, I have used the quotes in articles and letters. A perfect addition to your library if you write to or about children.
__label__2 Highly recommended baby doll!: This laughing calin doll is perfect for young toddlers. She is small and light enough to be carried around easily. Her expression is very pleasant. She is the perfect "play Mommy" doll. She appears very well made and durable.
__label__2 This is one of the best movies from the late '80s: It's been close to twenty years since I watched this film. At first, it looks like an 80's attempt at a date movie, but this one goes much further than that. It has a captivating plot, likable characters, and one of the greatest soundtracks of all time. Even though I'm not a fan of musicals or dancing, I still found myself enjoying this story. If you are a fan of Saturday Night Fever, you will most likely appreciate Dirty Dancing as well.
__label__2 IT WAS THE BEST!!!: IT WAS THE BEST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN. IT WAS ROMANTIC AS WELL AS EXCITING. NOTHING COULD EVER TOP IT. PATRICK SWAYZE IS THE BEST ACTOR IN THE WORLD AND JENNIFER GREY WAS PRETTY GOOD TOO.
__label__1 Ordered for Christmas but...: Ordered for delivery for Christmas but after order was told it would not be delivered by Christmas. It was confirmed at purchase time to be delivered before Christmas. Now I have to go back out and find it in a store and then try and return this one to Amazon. Not much fun...
__label__2 One of the best movies ever made!!: This movie is the best one I have ever seen. I have the soundtrack and it's great too. The story, dancing and music is unbelievable!! I think everyone should see this at least once in their life!!
__label__2 I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!!: I always thought this was a lame movie, but I really love it now that I've seen it. Yes, it IS a chick-flick, so if you don't like those types of movies, don't buy it.
__label__2 I love this movie!: Jennifer Gray and Patrick Swayze are the terrific duo in this dancing romance on the road! I love the song Baby, when she is teaching him the cha-cha! I definatly recommend this movie to everybody. A time-less classic!
__label__2 sexy/thoughtful: this album especialy the tittle cut remedy makes me think that he really knows how woman want to be treated. keep up the good work we really need "brothas" out there that still think like you.
__label__2 8701-Usher!: This cd is HOT ... I love it. One of my favorite Usher cds ever! Has several hits... One of his best ever! Must have for the fan of Usher! I am happy to have it for my own collection! Its great from start to finish!
__label__2 LOVE THIS ALBUM!!!: Usher's "8701" is one of the best R&B albums I have EVER purchased. EVERY SONG on this album is beautiful. I always like Usher but with this album.....I'ma die-hard fan! He does a great job balancing the up tempo songs and the ballads. The fast tracks make you wanna get up and dance and the slow ones make you wanna cry and just call that special someone in your life and just tell them "I love you". His voice is excellent on every track and most importantly.....the man lets you know what love is about. The jewels on this album are "U remind me", "U got it bad", "Twork it out", "Can u help me", "If I want to", "Good ol' Ghetto" and "TTP" (lol, basically every track on the album!). On a last note....those of you who know what good R&B music is, this album is a must, TRUST ME!!!
__label__1 who would have thought..: that this cute little guy by the name of Usher who came out with the awesome "My Way" would grow up to be an arrogant womanizer with about as much originality as Britney Spears. Grow up Usher. Be a man. You either have the talent/personality/ and originality or you don't. Leave r & b and go be one of Brit's back up dancers.
__label__2 2nd BEST CD I'VE EVER HEARD!!: Second to NSYNC'S, "Celebrity", this CD is my favorite of all time! When you want to listen to 13 of 15 songs on a CD, you know it's good! This CD has an amazing balance of ballads and fast trax and rap. And the ballads are INCREDIBLE! "U Got It Bad" is one of the best songs I've ever heard in my life. I would DEFINITELY recommend that anyone a fan of Pop, R&B or Rap to get this CD, YOU WILL LOVE IT!
__label__2 usher was creative then: now THIS is the usher I liked who actually released good music instead of that stale let it burn and yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah. He was on fiyah in summer 2001 till 2002 with his blazing hot videos and being himself with a little bit of michael jackson influence instead of trying to be his minime like he does all the time today and not even be close to dancing as great.
__label__1 Don't Bother: A horrible movie which makes Dull & ordinary (with the exception of sex) one of the most complex writers/individuals that Ireland has produced. If cinematography alone is your sole requisite in a film by all means buy the DVD. One good aspect of the movie; Ewan & Susan Lynch's rendition of 'The Lass of Aughrim'...but you can download that.
__label__1 ewan mcgregor's hot: although ewan mcgregor is my ultimate favorite actor in the entire world..i have to say that this was a terrible movie. and yes..sadly, ewan co-produced it! <i don't why he would ever sign to be co-producer of THAT film..it should have been moulin rouge!> So back to the movie..I hated Susan Lynch in this film. has she ever heard of shaving? I know this is back in the day so I'll give her that much. But she was a little TOO hairy for me. This movie is really graphic and it shows a lot of uh..stuff. Ewan was so cute in it! But I think there could have been a better Nora picked. This is definitlely an erotic film like the actual overview says. the reason why i gave this film only 1 star is because it was so hard to follow! i figured out in the middle that time was jumping VERY fast. they should have dates as subtitles. It jumped ahead quickly, it was too graphic, and overall..it's probably one of the worst films i have ever seen. sorry ewan!!!
__label__2 Riveting Reading!: Fast paced, I could hardly put it down. It left me wanting more. I,will recommend this book to family and friends
__label__1 good for a b-day prsent?: my brother loves these game. )hes favorite is the one for computer but we lost the disk when i was in kindergarten) when this comes out tell me how great it is!
__label__1 TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE.: C'mon people! How fun is it to watch a racist, lewd, borrish, and dumb person beating up people for no f-----g reason. As little as possible. All the film does is show two unorthadox sleep in car all night, hold up bars just because there are black people there, and reapeatedly getting the same food as 24 minutes ago. And a point that should go out, THERE IS NO CAR CHASE! Just someone chasing a train! I will end by saying that this trashy film deserved no oscars! BYE!
__label__2 Fast moving police drama: This is a story about a New York City police detective (Gene Hackman) and his partner (Roy Scheider) and their relentless pursuit to discover a drug source. The high speed chase scenes take them far outside the city limits and get deadly when an attempt is made to kill Gene Hackman's character ("Popeye" Doyle).This is good police drama and quite entertaining.
__label__2 Timeless, Greyish and Well Structured Police Story: There is a scene at the beginning of this classic movie wherein everyone seems to be having a great time in a bar when from nowhere a sort of stop-time moment occurs when dectective Popeye eyeing some locals knows for dead-center certainty something major is wrong. From there it is only a matter of piecing together (like the ubiquous and sinsiter car) the plot. This gritty, seemingly greyish and astonishingly well-edited movie offers a powerful glimpse into the mechanisms and travails of international corruption
__label__2 THE BEST CRIME MOVIE EVER MADE!: French Connection is a exciting action/crime film starring Gene Hackman as Popeye Dole, a N.Y. Narcotics Cop who is investigating the recent flow of herion coming into N.Y. He and his partner (Roy Shrieder) get into the absorbing process of phone tapping, following suspects, and stakeouts. A real good crime movie from director William Friedkin. One of the best films ever made, also has the most exciting chase scene in history. A winner!!
__label__2 THE FRENCH CONNECTION: DEFINITELY KEEPS YOUR INTEREST. IT CONTAINS SO MANY DIFFERENT FACETS THAT ONE WANTS TO VIEW IT SEVERAL TIMES OVER, JUST SO THAT YOU HAVEN'T MISSED ANYTHING!
__label__1 inadequate disclosure: Received the book in a timely fashion but the CD-ROM and the Timeline were NOT included. This should have been clearly stated in the listing! The Timeline was to be a 60th birthday present for my twin sister.
__label__1 Low quality sound: The volume is low and even with my Tv turned all the way up I can barely hear it : (
__label__2 THE REAL PLAYAS: TWO PLAYAS PLAYING HARD TO GET WITH EACH OTHER MORRIS CHESTNUT AND VIVICA A. FOX PLAY GAMES WITH EACH OTHER . THIS IS JUST A MOVIE ABOUT THE PERSON WHO HAS THE BEST GAME I ENJOYED IT AND I LIKED IT A LOT. IF YOU LIKE COMEDY AND IF YOU ARE A FAN OF ANY OF THE CHARACTERS IN THE MOVIE THEN YOU WOULD DEFINITELY LIKE THIS MOVIE.
__label__2 GREAT resource!: I've been in a Disciple bible study class for 5 years and have seen others with this book; finally decided to order it for myself. It's a great resource and has good information that is factual and concise. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the Bible!
__label__2 AWESOME!: Awesome guide! The best as finally been put out for a reference price guide on the best ever movie star MARILYN MONROE! Even she would be amazed I bet! Terrific job! Thanks for all the hard effort in making it! All worth it!
__label__2 Crystal Growing Science Kit: This was a gift to my grandson and he was mesmerized and could not wait to start growing the crystals. I told him I did something like that when I was a child, grew rock formations in a fish bowl.
__label__1 I never thought Meryl Streep could give a "bad" performance.: I never thought that Maryl Streep could give a bad performance. It is difficult to believe this is the same actress from Sopjie's Choice and The French Lt.'s Woman. Oh, well, I guess one stinker in an otherwise glorious career is to be forgiven. Don't watch unless you are a "movie masochist."
__label__1 Okay !!!!: This movie was okay, it wasn't a 10 more like a 3..... I could have gone without buying this foolishness
__label__1 Too drawn out!: I usually enjoy reading this author however that was not the case in this particular title. The plot was too drawn out.
__label__2 Hilarious: This movie was even funnier than the first. I love how they brought back characters from the first movie and continued storylines. Definitely recommended, but you need to make sure you see the first movie before this one. :)I'd stop after this one though, Tremors 3 was pretty bad.
__label__1 Not quite...: Tremors 2 doesn't live up to what I had hoped for. The movie has its funny moments, but just doesn't hook the viewer like the original. A key ingredient missing in this movie is Kevin Bacon. If you haven't seen the first Tremors, I would strongly recommend NOT viewing the sequel. However, if you enjoyed the first one, the sequel may be worth your time.
__label__1 Worthless!: They peeled off within a week. I cleaned the tub; wiped it down with alcohol and even put a heater in it for a couple hours to warm up the surface. I did everything I could to insure they would adhere well, but to no avail.
__label__1 I really don't recommend this product.: Purchased this a while back, and was disappointed from the moment I opened the box. The construction was flimsy and the mic didn't even work. All this thing did was waste time and money.
__label__1 drying and sticky: I didn't care for this product at all. I found that it dried out my hair and was also very sticky. I will not purchase again...
__label__2 This book is possibly the best I've ever read.: This book is extraodinary. I started reading it expecting it to be boreing. After the first eight pages, I was reading it every free second I got. I can guarantee that anyone will love this book.
__label__1 A story as lush as the planet it is set on!: Come on! This book is over rated. It is an amusing story but unengaging. The characters are cold and it is difficult to empathise with them. I did read the next two books to see how the story was resolved...but it wasn't, it turned into the X-files! i.e. continuous suspense, convolutions, but no resolution. A story must have a beginning, middle, and, and, um, an end? The recent appearance of the Dune 'brand extension' books "House Atreides" and " 'Harkonen" confirm that the story continues, be it chronologically before or after the original Dune. Should have been a trilogy at most.
__label__1 A Great Book, Horrible Price: I had this book. I've read it twice. When I moved I left it so that the next person would be able to read it and enjoy it, knowing that I would probably get a digital version the next time I wanted to read it. $14.99 for a 40 year old book that can be picked up in innumerable used book stores? That much for a book that is 40 years old? There's no reason for it to be more expensive than a print version. Now, instead of buying it, I'm going to pass. I'm also going to pass on all the sequels I might have bought after it, and all because Penguin doesn't understand the digital world yet. Readers shouldn't have to pay for a publisher's mistake. Set a reasonable price for this book, and I'd happily purchase it!
__label__1 predictable: After 10 pages everybody could guess the end.I just hate predictable book the first part of this book is worth reading but if your not an hard core sci-fi fan drop it after.
__label__1 It;s just not very good: I read the Dune novels as a teenager and recently started re-reading them 15 years later.Dune Messiah is exactly as I remembered it: a disappointment not just in comparison to Dune, but a true mediocrity in its own right, with a surprising amount of fragements of thoughts and ruminations that just don't make any sense. The point of Dune Messiah, and Children of Dune, is to enjoy the much grand God-Emperor of Dune.
__label__2 You won't regret: Simply the best novek I have read. This not just a sci-fi novel. The world created by Herbert can only suit a envoirement in future. The story starts somehow complicated but soon you will discover the intelligence of the author. If you haven't read it yet, this must be first thing you have to read.
__label__2 Brief, but to the point: This book is very brief, but I guess this is how its supposed to be since it seems Frank Herbert wanted it to be a link between Dune before Paul, and the Dune after Paul. The end of the book is the perfect way to take us to the next stage, the children of Muadib.
__label__2 The Greatest Novel Ever Written: Words cannot describe the depth of this book's greatness. Not only is Dune the greatest single sci-fi novel ever written, it is the greatest novel ever written. It introduces the reader to a new and fantastic world, more realistic than any other in literature. Frank Herbert was a genius. Paul is a little stiff, but at the same time, he is more "real" than most people I know. This is the first novel that I've read that wore me out reading it, that is how powerful it is. There are scenes that simply left me physically exhausted after reading them. No book I have ever read before or since has drawn me in like Dune does. Enough good things cannot be said about Dune. It is pitiful that the Modern Library skipped this in it's listing. Dune blows Ulysses, Gatsby and anything by Faulkner completely out of the water. Whether you're a sci-fi fan or not, you MUST read Dune. You will NOT regret it.
__label__2 The best book I ever read: Dune is the best book I ever read. I know it is not a good argument to persuade you, but it is the only thing I can say. Read it.
__label__1 Great writing - poor publishing: ACE reprint of 'Dune' - ISBN0-441-17271-7never before have i seen a book contain so many print & editorial errors...ink application is not homogeneous, resulting in many blots & light print areas...print pressure is inconstant, resulting in wavy print & apparent font reduction...then there are the editorial errorspg. 108 "the gift is the blessing of the river" <giver>...the most egregious so farif there had been physical defect allowing return to place of purchase, this paperback would surely have been exchanged for a previously published edition of better quality
__label__1 Do yourself a favor and don't open it!: I rather liked "Dune" but this poor excuse for a sequel is just plain awful! When i closed the book I couldn't even remember what it was all about. So unless you are a great fan of Frank Herbert or intend to read the entire series, don't bother.
__label__1 Sorry, but I really didn't like it very much: I guess it's just personal taste, but I'm sorry to say that I did not really like Dune that much. I really wanted to; I know it has a great reputation, and legions of fans who have read it multiple times. I just finished reading it last night. The overall setting and the complex story were fine. The opening scene, the visit from the Reverend Mother, was intriguing. But, somehow the writing style for the rest of the book just didn't click with me. You know how some books have wonderfully-crafted language and sentence structure that mezmerizes you? Well, this book was not like that. Time and again I found some passages awkwardly worded. As well, while there was a great assortment of characters, I felt no emotional attachment to any of them.I had previously read a couple of Herbert's sci-fi novels, and liked them, but this one, well, doesn't get 5 stars from me. Your mileage may vary...I won't be reading any of the remaining books.
__label__2 Read the Series: I only read Dune after I had seen the movie (2 hour version) and was overwhelmed! I then proceded to read the rest of the series (6 books) and tape all three (the two, three and four-hour) versions of the movie. The book Dune is one you must read thru at least twice, including the glossary and index before all the ramifications of the 'history' start to become clear (The Butlerian Jihad, for example) and the realizations will change your first impressions, and so you will READ IT AGAIN!! I would love to read a 'prequal' of this series, but alas, for naught. For a great time on a rainy Saturday, get all six, sit down, and read them in order. You will not be disapointed.
__label__2 DUNE ...Best Science Fiction Book I have ever read!: Of course that is just what every other review thinks but hell it's the truth! I picked this book up from my girlfriends brother for a school report... (yeah i don't read muchy for my enjoyment) but anyway i read it and now i want more. This book has got me reading for the hell of it and i am purchasing Dune Messaih and Children of Dune and can't wait to read them. Dune changed my outlook on reading with it's indept look at politics, treachery and the way these two twist together in the Dune. I love it.
__label__2 A Lifetime Favorite: I love the original Dune books and have also enjoyed the new ones. I own the entire series and can't think of a better recommendation to give.
__label__1 Kindle version: I have climbed out of bed to write this for you, because I can take it no longer. Whoever made the kindle version should be fired. The book itself is great. However, random missing spaces, extra spaces, italics that begin or end when they shouldn't, mis-spellings of stillsuit as "stulsuit"....Please, buy another version. This is an embarrassment to e-publishing....and you'd think with it being on the computer it'd be easier to check for errors. Guess not.Look elsewhere for your ebook copy of Dune.
__label__1 Embarrassing Ebook: After reading the Kindle sample of this book, I have to agree with the many critical reviews of this edition. This is not a review of the writing, which is excellent, but of this electronic edition of the title.Aside from the fact that $15 for the electronic edition of a book that is over 40 years old and has already been widely published as a mass market paperback for for half the price is obscene, the quality of this Kindle edition is so horrible I would not want it if it was free. DUNE is one of the great classics of scifi literature but this ebook is an embarrassment to both the publisher and the author and I would urge anyone interested in reading this book to pass on this edition. Instead, find any one of the cheap tens of thousands of used copies that are easily available of this title.
__label__2 DUNE is the book for our time: I was only 4 years old when I first saw the screen version of this book and then I was hooked. Granted I shouldn't have gotten interested in the book just because of the movie, but the movie went well with the book. It put a face to the all the characters that I was so fascinated with. DUNE should be a book that should be read in high school, and studied. There is a message for those who read the book and those who are die hard fans of Frank Herbert will understand and relate it to present day....
__label__1 What was the point of this book again?: This book was a complete let-down from the first one. The ending was well done, but other than that I cannot find anything at all good about this book. The first half of the book is completely pointless, unlike the first book we don't need to know about the characters because they are basically the same. The only reason I finished this book was to read the next book.
__label__2 No doubt about it!: One look at all these reviews will leave you with no doubt that this is one of the best science fiction stories ever told. But wait! The best is yet to come. There are five other books in the series. My advice, however, is to skip Dune Messiah and go right to Children of Dune. The second book isn't nearly as good as the first; the third is even better. Herbert's writing improved with age, and God Emperor of Dune, Heretics of Dune, and Chapterhouse: Dune will blow you away even if you just sort-of like the original Dune.
__label__2 Dune: This is my favorite novel of all time. I have read and re-read it since I was a teenager. Frank Herbert was an absolute genius. Science fiction is not usually my favorite genre of reading but this is the exception. I have the entire collection of Dune books including the rare Dune Encyclopedia. A must read!
__label__2 Interesting continuation.: Like dune, it is flawed, spending too much time on internal monologue and exposition better left to the reader. Also like Dune, it is brilliant in many ways--symbolism, philosophy, intrigue, etc. I think one of the reasons that people didn't like it as much as Dune was because they were expecting more of the same and got, instead, a very changed universe (with several contradictions). Sequels in far-future sci fi always lack the wonder of discovering a new world; but in a way, watching the development is just as fascinating. If you liked Dune, read Dune Messiah.
__label__2 just a few steps to total enlightenment: 1. Read the book during the summer-time2. Download the song "Final Dream" from the 80s movie "Dune"3. Immerse yourself in water and/or listen to the song.4. Break out in tears.This book will change your life forever. :)
__label__2 Dune: Dune is one of the most inspirational sci/fi books that I hav ever read. The technology in the book seemed to be extremely none feasible to the recent human culture thst sorrounds us as a people. The story of the chosen one,Paul Mau'dib a man that was given to the fremen as there saviour. He was the chosen one, the only male that could stand to the poisonious juice that only the benajesuits have the power as women to resist the power of the jui ce in order to become one of there own. As the story went on thw character of mau'dib feel in tot he world of the fremen and wanted to help them out of there fight for freedom . He was the only one that could do it for them. If he didn't do it he would just be wasting his talent. His talent to control the world in his fingers. He do it all he had the people afraid of what he could do , and it was all over one little insignifacant thing. He now controls the spice and will for a long time never be harmed.
__label__2 Just the Best: Honestly, this book is one of the best I have ever read.(I have read a lot of books). Its plot, characterization and flawless storytelling make for one compelling read.
__label__2 Not the best book ever, but it is up there.: This book made me order the rest of the series, and even tempted me to buy the ones written by his son, despite the horrible reviews they've been given on here. You will lose yourself in the world Mr. Herbert spins. The 2 movies made from this book don't do it justice.
__label__1 An over-rated piece of fiction: I had several close friends recommend Dune to me, all proclaiming how amazing it was as a novel, only to hear later that not one of them finished it for the same reason: "it was kinda boring." If you're asking yourself why someone would praise and recommend a book that they find to be boring then you're just as mystified as I am. I have yet to meet anyone who has read Dune who liked it or ever finished it.The books major problem is it has too many minor characters and very poor character development. The lead character, Paul, is a good example, as he has no personality, or any interesting qualities whatsoever. Sadly, all the characters are this way.I did finish this book, after forcing myself to keep reading for six months, and I will say that it eventually does get more interesting, but only in the last two chapters.
__label__2 Warm and self sacrificing: Jane and Tom meet fall in love and there are many obstacles to overcome. Different ending bittersweet. Loved it. Will not tell all as it will ruin the movie.
__label__1 Horribly Disappointing: First, I will be upfront: I didn't get very far in this movie. There are few movies that I will stop in the middle (in fact, I can't think of any), but this was one of them. I was very disappointed with this movie. It makes fun of Jane Austen. It criticizes everything about Jane Austen's time period. Everything in the movie seemed designed to mock, from the pond filled with scum in front of a great house to an unpolished mirror that could hardly be looked in to show the sisters reflections. It blatantly attacks Christianity ( or being faithful to your spouse before you ever even meet them, by keeping your wedding vows). As strange as it sounds, I felt like I was being attacked through the movie screen. It is a movie full of lies. Particularly the lie that by being faithful to your spouse you are missing out. The opposite is true. Hopefully, the movie improved by the end, but I couldn't make it that far to find out.
__label__2 Curl up and enjoy on a Rainy Day with a Cup of Tea.: If you remotely enjoy Jane Austin's works, this story is sure to please. Anne Hathaway is stunning and believable as Jane Austin. James McAvoy portrays young Jane's love interest and their chemistry is fantastic. Romantic, witty, Sad, funny, passionate - all things that make a great "chick" flick. You'll wish it wouldn't end. One word to the wise - Don't subject your husbands / boyfriends to this movie or you'll never hear the end of it.
__label__2 GREAT MOVIE: Anne Hathaway did a great job as Jane Austin and this movie stayed very true to her real life (what we know of it anyway).
__label__1 Contrived and so far from what we know about Jane Austen it is impossible to make the leap: This is no "Mrs. Brown." It is a fictitious assumption about Jane Austen and her paramours made into a romantic tale that hardly holds up with plot contrivances galore and the inevitable heartbreak. Watch it once then forget that you did. It is harmless.
__label__2 one word: unbelievable: this is truly the most compelling book on commercial office space that i have read, and i have read all of them. It is short,concsice and to the point.Tunis captures the essence of what it means to negotiate for a piece of space and delivers it in a way that the layman can understand even the more complex points. A one of a kind book that i would heartily recommend for anybody looking to get in the commercial real estate field or just searching for office space.
__label__2 Greaat Movie: This is a great movie!Its 1969. Alan Parish has troubles with his father. He finds a game named Jumanji at a construction site. He plays with his former friend Sarah Whiddle. They play, and until the game reads 5 or 8, in the jungle he must wait. The game isn't played until 26 years later by a young girl and boy that will be living in the Parish home. Peter, the young boy, rolls a 5, or 8, and he is unleashed. This wild movie is all in one day! It turns out they can not play until Sarah Whiddle joins. They find her and the whole town, including her try to believe it was the father that killed him. I hate to say it, but the ending is sad. Once they finish the game, it should all dissappear. Robin Williams isn't the only one relased from the game. Who else? Go buy it now!
__label__2 My Son's FAvorite: I did not see this movie in the theatre, but we rented it last year on video and really enjoyed it. Surprisingly, however, my 5-year-old son was wild about it! I had heard it was too scary for young kids, but he loved it. In fact, it has become one of his all time favorite movies, and we have rented it so many times (at his request) that we're going to buy the video for him for Christmas. The special effects in this movie are great, and (unlike the professional reviewers), I think the character development is fine. I think reviewers forget that sometimes people watch movies just for entertainment and fun!
__label__2 Jumanji is fun!: What a great movie and a clever concept! A board game that sucks you into it, and must be finished by the originals who played the game. I remember seeing Jumanji in the movie theatre when it first came out, and this past weekend had the opportunity to rewatch it (thank you resale DVDs!)Starring Robin Williams and Bonnie Hunt, the action is fast paced and easy to follow. No swearing in this movie makes it appropriate for all ages, though little ones might be frightened by the rampaging animals. There is nothing Disneylike in their qualities.Still, the story of sticking together and teamwork prevail throughout the entire film. Bebe Neuwirth and David Alan Greier are great in their supporting roles. Bonnie Hunt gets some of the best lines in the film with regards to cheating and a downtown sale. An early Kirstin Dunst is also great.If you have never seen Jumanji, I encourage you check it out. It's fun and you always wonder what the game is going to come up with next.
__label__2 Day-Timer stand: I was tired of having to pick up my Day-Timer every time I wanted to view it, with this stand I can leave it at the corner of my desk and view it at an easy angle to see without ever having to pick it up. It is sturdy enough to write on and has storage space below for stationary & letterhead. My only complaint is the high price, I would have bought a different brand if I could have found the same thing cheaper.
__label__1 So where's the rest of it????: I was intrigued by the now cancelled TV show and so decided to pick up the book that the show was based on so I could have some closure on the story. Unfortunately, the book is nothing more than a lead in to the show. The books ends about where the show picks up. Needless to say I am still in the dark about where the story goes and how it ends. Very frustrating. It was a decent book up to the abrupt and unsatisfying ending.
__label__1 a sorry bit of commercialism: I should have known better after the "Rose Red" trash. This is a cheap ploy to sucker you in to watching the series. Not only that , I've noticed Stephen King's current writing is concerned more with his pet peeves, political leanings, and predjudices than with telling a good story. Maybe it is time for King to retire.
__label__2 Great toy! Great service!: I ordered this for my daughter because she lost her other 'Scat' beanie baby. It is a very durable toy. The order came quickly in the mail and in very good shape.
__label__1 Fuel Pump: Though I'm sure that this pump would've operated properly,,, I was Extremely Disappointed that the Carter pump that was sent to me, looked NOTHING like the pump in the picture (instead, it was the newer style, bolt-together type),, and when you're trying to restore an old Mustang and the pump is suppose to appear a certain way (like in the advertised picture), that's what you expect to receive. It's all about the details!Doug S.
__label__1 Plays but is noisy: This is noisy CD player it makes a whiring sound when CD's are played. Terrible fast forward and backwards, goes to slow. Awkward to use. Worst CD player I have ever owned. Don't buy it, you'll be sorry.
__label__1 This book is being revised - so the FACTS can be adjusted: I started reading it, but couldn't continue when I found out that the "Facts" were being altered by Kerry and Brinkley. In the meantime, read "Unfit for Command". It gives several excerpts from this book anyway. Then maybe when the new version of the NON fiction comes out I'll read it. Although, I thought NON fiction was truth and truth couldn't be changed... I guess it depends on whose truth it is. I gave it one star because it's pretty thick and I think it probably took a lot of imagination to come up with that much.
__label__1 Kerry's Tour Of Duty For North Vietnam: The book has no information on Kerry's "tour of duty" with Hanoi Jane and her gang.Nothing on how North Vietnam's leader dredit Kerry & Fonda for saving North Vietnam from defeat. Nothing on how Kerry's family financial benefitted from the normalization of relations with his old comrades in the "new" Vietnam.
__label__1 Not a hero.: Offshore for so long in his first tour. Then back for only four months, received minor wounds, got medals and "out" while others slogged through jungle in the real war.....Kerry is no hero. A biased book the purpose of which is to win an election, not to give a true account of the war.Kerry came back and accused our soldiers of hideous acts of cruelty and murder; he testitied to these facts while our men were still there. Some of them were even being held prisoners by the enemy at the time. How do you think they were treated by the enemy after hearing what our soldiers did to their people?A disgusting excuse for an objective book. SAVE YOUR MONEY.
__label__1 Campaign for Kerry: To call this book an unbiased look at Kerry's life is extremely naive. From the very beginning it reads like a cheesy campaign commercial. If you like Kerry and his politics, you'll like the book, conversely if you don't, you won't.
__label__1 Waste of time and money: This book is a waste of valuable paper. Kerry is a freaking traitor and only received commendations because he had friends in high places. To anyone who supports him and his too obvious lies, you're dumber than I thought Americans ever would be. Kerry didn't do any more than any of our boys are doing out there every day, and less than most. I hated the book and have no respect for the man behind it.
__label__1 Shame on Amazon.com's Political Bias: The following disclaimer appears on the "Unfit for Command" Swift boat book:"Important note from Amazon.com: We've decided to suspend our normal customer review policies and rules for this title. For example, we usually prohibit ad hominem attacks. That policy in particular seems to be incompatible with presidential election year politics. Therefore, short of obscenities, reviews on this book are now a free-for-all. We take no responsibility for the following discussion. Aren't presidential election years great? Have fun!"Why is there no such disclaimer issued for this book? It seems that Amazon's political bias is showing! Shame! Shame! Shame!Until this same disclamer appears under "Tour of Duty" I will take my book buying business elsewhere!
__label__2 Liberals Read This Book!: A Masterpiece!Reviewer: A reader from New York, United StatesTo say that this is an informative easy read is to grossly understate thefacts. I have been a lifelong democrat...ok a liberal democrat. I alwaysjust assume that all of these guys are just Rush Limbaugh clones, allsinging from his hymnal. A friend of mine convinced me to read this book andI must admit...I have started to re-think some of my views. This guy stateshis opinion & gives you the FACTS to back it up...it's hard to dispute whathe says. I'm still a democrat (notice I left the "d" lower case), but nolonger consider myself a liberal...I can't believe it myself...READ THISBOOK!
__label__2 what a world: A friend of mine recommended this CD to me and I have to admit it was way beyond anything I ever imagined. I have practically worn the CD out listening to it and hanging on every surreal nuance within the deep lyrics and the haunting music. Being a sax player myself, I was especially inspired by how fat the sounds of the saxaphones are......absolutely incredible!
__label__2 Chilling!: I've been a Morphine fan for quite a while. And when I heard the news of Mark Sandman's (the singer)death, I feared the worst...NO MORE MEZMERIZING BEAUTY from the guys of Morphine. I recieved "The Night" on its release date and listened to it three times right away. While as a whole, While The Night is not the best of "Morphine's" albums (this album is different enough to be in a category itself)...there are songs on the disc that will become legendary to Morphine fans. The album is simply "Chilling". You get the usual Morphine dose of sax, bass, drum and VOICE...but with a new twist. There are some unique sounds on this album that just adds to the sad feeling one gets when the thought reaches the brain: "Where would Morphine had gone if Mark Sandman had not traveled into THE NIGHT?" Thank you Mark...for the beauty.
__label__1 Dangerous!: I have tried this item a few times and learned:The strainer top does not hold tight to the cooker, nor is there anything in the design of the cooker part to permit the strainer top to attach to it. This means that when you tip the cooker over to pour out the water, the top falls off! Danger of scalding and steam burns!It worked adequately for rice vermicelli, which one would normally just soak in boiling water anyway. When I tried it with penne, the pasta pieces on the bottom of the container didn't even get wet from the hot water, never mind cooked! I still had to remove the pasta at the end of the so-called cooking time, and transfer it to a pot of boiling water in order to get it cooked!This so-called pasta cooker is a waste of time. Not a waste of money if you want to have a plastic vase for long-stemmed flowers... that's what you can safely use it for!
__label__1 Misleading information: I used to geocache and so I read this book with interest. The information is misleading ("GPSr: Slang of a GPS receiver." An initialism is hardly "slang") to slightly dangerous (the author recommends turning off the GPS for most of your trek to "save batteries." Instead of losing your breadcrumb trail back to your camp or car, why not just carry spare batteries?).It appeared to me that the author had never really spent much time geocaching. Take his advice with a grain of salt.
__label__2 A Classic: This is a movie that my mother took me and my siblings to when it first came out. I remember loving the title and thinking it would be really scary since it was about murder and death. What I remember most about it is Maggie Smith saying, "Dickie! Where's my Dickie?!" I bought it for sentimental reasons. It's a really great movie, if only for all the stars that appear. It's also got Truman Capote, who is strange and wonderful. It's got lots of twists and turn. The introduction is a little long - the piece where everyone arrives at the mansion. It's a little gimicky, but it's Neil Simon, so that's to be expected. Would I recommend it to others? Sure. Was I a tiny bit disappointed that it was not as wonderful as I remember it? Sure. The last thirty years made it a little better in my mind than it actually is. It's got some good extras, but not as many as I generally like. But it's a good nostalgia pick and there are some great performances.
__label__2 This is one funny movie!!: This movie is hilarious!! I found it amazing because this film was truely a pionear of its genre(parody). This was before Lethal weapon and even before the movie "Clue" it is indeed one of the first of its kind.It follows the same basic premise as most other murder mystery movies but it turns all of the stereotypes on their head.For example-The butler is blind and this is but one many things that make this movie unique. You can tell the producer and director had a lot of fun making this one.The first time you watch it you can have a dozen different guesses for how the movie turns out but you will not be right. I love this movie!!
__label__2 personal top #10: If you haven't had the chance to see it then trust me and please buy it! Laughs are assured!!
__label__2 Great comedy from before foul language: This movie has always been a favorite of mine. I originally saw it when it came out, and remember all the crazy stuff that went on. Later it became a thing where we would rent it every so often and watch it, waiting for certain parts. It draws on a great cast, a strange script, and sets that fit the storys mood. Its a film that would never be made today because they would never bring in so many great actors, and hire a top notch screenplay writer. Its easier now to just get one known actor, or a script that relies on foul language and gross jokes with whoever starring in it. I enjoy that type of movie too, but this is not like that. This is a fun movie, thats the best way to describe it.
__label__1 Pathetic Attempt at Bond: This film is awful. The plot is a twisted Bond-film scenario with only difference being that Disel isn't a professional spy, but recruited by the US Government because he appears to be tough and, at the same time, a criminal. The special effects were okay, but very predictable and hardly believable. The film also had some lines from previous Bond films, and even some screen shots that looked awfully similar to some of the past Bond movies. But Diesel is no Bond. He ... as a spy, and is an awkward actor at that.
__label__1 <*** This movie is BAD! ****>: I was able to see this movie in Europe for free and let me just say it was terrible; big explosions, and big stunts are the only dosis you'll be getting, because as far as a good story or a bit of acting is concerned not a chance!...unless showing off your muscles every second can be call acting.Vin Diesel is one of the worst actors I've ever seen, I wish Hollywood would give a chance to real actors who are just waitingfor the opportunity.Please don't allow this to continue, bad movies must be stopped once and for all.Rent this movie if it makes you happy but don't be another victim, or worst yet another supporter of this movie.
__label__1 Top 10 reasons you saw "XXX": 10.You're a girl that has a crush on Vin Diesel 9.You're a kid that has no idea who James Bond is. 8.You're a serious movie goer looking for comedy relief. 7.You thought it was rated XXX. 6.You're a student from the USC film class "Bad Movies 101". 5. You had nothing better to do with your time and money. 4.You're a first-time moviegoer that was tricked by your 15-year-old sister. 3.You're a critic that's in hot water with his boss. 2.You believe that the WWF and WCW is a real sport. 1.That Vin Diesel guy is hot even if he can't act.
__label__2 Please! It's Entertainment Not Reality!: There's only one reason to see this movie. Entertainment. It's just that simple. If you're looking for profound, this whole movie genre isn't it. If your looking for fast paced action, witty dialogue, an edgy sound track that compliments the plot... a wild, unique approach to stunts, and a totally unconventional, irreverent "secret agent"... then this movie is for you.Vin Diesel makes a very entertaining, believable Xander Cage, but give him a break...this isn't a Shakespeare movie! It's a spy movie and does follow the genre rules, but not enough to make it like any other. Don't take it too seriously and enjoy the ride!
__label__1 Mindless, Pointless and Insulting: Bad. Just plain awful. Please skip this mindless drivel. The only people who liked this film are girls who think that Vin Diesel is "cute" and people who liked "Fast & The Furious" (another snoozer). I am glad that I saw it on my friend's PC and not at the theaters, so that I didn't waste $7.50. Anyone who watched this film and was not insulted by its mindnumbing dialogue, horrid plot and overall crudeness should be ashamed of themselves. Not even Jean Claude himself could have saved this one. A total waste of time for the thinking movie goer. Hey kiddies, here's an idea; instead of watching this why not see a top-notch film like "Far From Heaven" or "The Hours" or even "Minority Report"? Oh, thats right, gotta use the old noggin for that one....never mind. It saddens me that movies have come to this.
__label__1 head for the XXX-it: I've only ever walked out of one movie, and this was it. I actually stayed for an hour, hoping it'd get better...but it actually got worse. The acting: bad, the stunts: bad, the plot: VERY bad. I wouldn't wish seeing this movie on my worst enemies (even thogh I have none). Save your money, send it to Sally Struthers or something.
__label__1 Unleaded: Probably one of the most pointless films with one of the most pointless stars of today....and the best thing is we can expect a sequel. Could someone please explain to me the appeal of Vin? I mean, he did show some promise in far superior films like Pitch Black and Saving Private Ryan but enough already.
__label__1 Triple Bad!!!: This movie doesn't even deserve one star. Vin Diesel is the worst actor. For ANYBODY to call him the "new James Bond" is sad and laughable. Say what you want about Roger Moore's performances as James Bond, Vin Diesel could NEVER compare to him and he was the worst James bond ever!! The stunts in this movie are awesome, but the acting and plot is HORRIBLE!! I felt ashamed that I watched this movie because it insulted my intelligence. This movie was SO bad and to think it was a block buster hit!!! Vin is sexy (although he sometimes force it), but nothing and I do mean NOTHING should excuse him for making this mess. C'mon Vin, do better next time!!
__label__1 HORRIBLE!!!!!!: Well i saw this movie on the night of its release... Just like most women in this world I am a HUGE VIN DIESEL fan... I saw him in the Fast and the Furious, Pitch Black, Boiler Room,and so on. I was SADLY DISSAPOINTED by this movie. It was long and dry. The funny parts were few and far between, and there was sooo much action in it that it was almost UNBEARABLE to watch. Between the mediocre acting and the tired fighting scenes. It leaves u drained. NOT VIN DIESELS FINEST HOUR I WILL SAY..
__label__2 Good introductory real options book for beginner or manager: It is a good introductory book on real options targeted at the audience of managers rather than experienced financial practitioners. Its contents covered financial options, binomial pricing and Black-Scholes model where the last ten chapters or so are case studies dedicated to applications of real options where it gives readers an idea how real options can be applied in diverse industries.It makes a good and easy read for anyone who wants a quick flavor of real options without going through too much of the horrible maths that derivatives and real options seems to have !I personally enjoy reading it from cover to cover.
__label__2 An American Classic: Although this extremely gifted author did an excellent job, a bit wordy for me. Just dont have the time to read this style of writing.
__label__2 Captivating: Been listening to the book for the last two weeks so I feel like I'm family. Doesn't get 5 stars because it gets a little too in love with its own voice, but for the most part a really good audio book.
__label__1 deplorable: this was the worst example of american literature ever published. warren feels the need to describe such trivial objects as doorknobs, the color of the street, or smell of the rain. is this really needed? this book could have easily been condensed into one half its size. the author's continuing mention of "The Great Twitch" has no impact on the average person's life. this book is a waste of your time, don't read it!
__label__1 Pointless: This book was profane and pointless, as is w/ most books I'm forced to read for English. I never knew being in AP ment I had to put up with my beliefs being violated. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!
__label__2 Extremely unappreciated: This is definately one of the most underrated books of all time. Many will believe that this book is about politics, but it is about life. Robert Penn Warren creates Jack Burden, a character who is more like a spectator then one who actually lives life. The writing style is wonderful, and some of the lines in this novel are extremely well written and created. I highly recommend this book to anyone who can survive the first chapter, it is definately worth it. Many themes can also be drawn from this book, a book that you will be thinking about long after you have finsihed.
__label__1 Thou Preachest Too Much!: This book has a preachy tone that current readers will find hard to take but at the core of this book there are useful truths and insights into the learning process. For the good student, this book will confirm what he or she already knows and may add a few additional touches to personal trouble spots. For the average to poor student, it may be hard to get past the school marmish tone to get to "the goods" this book has to offer. I'm afraid in today's environment, this book won't reach those who need it the most.
__label__2 Ladies & Gentlemen...it's The Rolling Stones!: I'm not the most analytical reviewer out there for some of you who want a "well-reasoned", "logically-based", "original", "thought-provoking" review. I simply like what I hear or I don't. But I love music and certain bands I have loved for 40 years. The Rolling Stones is one of them. I picked up the CD simply because it was the Rolling Stones. I listened to it and from the first it sounded just EXCELLENT. They kept to the formula and then spiked it! I'm not going to compare it to past albums, or group line-ups or anything. I cannot tell you if it is better or worse than other albums. This one just stands on it's own! If you do love the Rolling Stones, you will be floored! Let me just tell you that in their golden years, the Stones still had the "stones" to pull it off again. You pick this CD up for the heck of it, and you walk away 100% satisfied that you got your money's worth, and unlike Mick, YOU GET SATISFACTION! What a superb rocker!
__label__2 This is a great album, a thrilling display of funky brilliance and virtuosity.: You should listen to this album many many times, like for a whole evening, sipping Martinis or Margaritas or whatever you like to drink. It's one of their greats, along with "Some Girls", "Exile on Main Street" and the others. This one is notable for the funky guitars, the jazz influence, and Keith Richards sounding like he's singing in Humphrey Bogart's bar in "Casablanca". Most importantly, this album appears to have been very carefully made, with a tremendous shot of inspiration, and it gets better every time you hear it.
__label__2 say YES to THE STONES: THE STONES WERE A GREAT BAND AND ALMOST AS GOOS AS THE BEATLES.ALL THEIR ALBUMS INCLUDING THIS ONE ARE CLASSICS.IGNORE THE ONE STAR REVIEWS AND BUY THIS ONE.
__label__1 the same thing.....: The rolling stones are making the same music from 20 ago....and now..as multi-millionaries, they are playing to rebels..writting songs about bush etc...Ths is the only way to call the media attention?
__label__1 YUK..............: Are they still alive? This CD stinks!!!! They are living off Media Baby Boomers Hype!!! When was the last time they had a hit 1970?
__label__1 What a Bunch of Trash!: I have been patiently waiting for some new Stones and what do I finally get, this group of songs some south Philly garage band could have written. What a disgrace for the Stones to put out this Lousy album. I am deeply disturbed buy the fact that people are giving this rave reviews just because it's a Stones album. Be ashamed, Be very ashamed of yourselves for telling people this CD is worth their hard earned cash!
__label__1 Oh, Pleeeze: The lyrics on Biggerbang are so bad! If you have a brain, you will cringe. "...i'm just one of your cocks": How old are you guys!? Musically it's pretty rockin and tight. I wish you could turn down Jagger, not because of his singing which is really good but because the lyrics seem like they were written by a fourteen year old with a big ego.
__label__1 This CD reminds me of a not good CD: I was definately not ready for the disappointment I suffered when I decided to buy this instead of another Tom Waits CD. I was very sorry to see that the early music by the Cherry Poppin' Daddies was just as god-awful as all the other alternative music that I hate.I like mittens!
__label__2 Another winner: Another winner for Jance in the Joanna Brady series. I have read all of the books in the series and am currently reading the next installment, Dead Wrong. I love the Joanna Brady series and will not miss one. Jance has got a real winner here. I like this series far more that the J.P. Beaumont series. Also, there is no need to read the other books in the series before picking up this one. Jance brings everyone up to speed without any confusion if you start a book in the middle of the series. Great characterizations and storyline.
__label__2 TL!: Bought this cd many, many years ago. I can't truthfully name one song from it, but I will vouch for Tracy Lawrence, he's a good singer!!
__label__1 OK, but there's better stuff out there for the money: ....I think this thing is sortof nice the way it has an integrated Tape and CD, but generally I think it is really crappy compared to the Turtle Beach Audiotron. Granted that unit is designed to be connected to a real stereo, and not imitate a real stereo like this unit, but the support for formats, and features is 400% better on that unit.The Audiotron is also able to play icecast and shoutcast...
__label__1 Big Disappointment: Anyone who saw the stage production of JOSEPH AND THE AMAZING TECHNICOLOR RAINCOAT must be disappointed by the movie. The main problem is the staging of it as a play at a school, resulting in unrealistic and cutesy scenes of kids worshipfully smiling at singing adults. The music is good, but the narrator makes faces, and Danny Osmond with long hair and half-shaven looks like he just woke up from sleeping on the street. My advice if you have this video is to close your eyes, and just listen to the music.
__label__1 thumbs down: All the children magically popping up, some bad makeup, and a few sad tries at being funny is what makes this movie deserve such a low rating. I think they could have come up with a better Joseph than D. O.. I have seen it 6 times in live theater, and every time the show was better than the movie.
__label__2 Improves with age...: I thought this was a pretty good video. In response to one comment, I also wasn't wild about Maria Friedman compared to Laurie Beechman, but I warmed up to her on my second viewing. As for alternatives, a great choice would have been Liz Callaway, formerly of Cats, Anastasia, etc. Also, I don't know how much more complete this version could have been, other than the megamix, which was irrelevant anyway. If you have a choice, get the DVD because the documentary is worth watching.
__label__2 Joseph ...: All I have to say is that I love it! The music is awesome, still love Donny Osmond and he's excellent in this production.
__label__2 Best Musical of All Time: Nothing better than learning a Bible Lesson through so much entertainment. I wish there were more DVD's out like this. Enjoy!
__label__2 Can't get enough!!!!!: I have seen a few broadway shows in the past, but when I saw Joesph for the first time in Salt Lake City I was blown away. I instantly went out and bought the DVD and every Sunday my family and sit down and watch it togather. The set up with the school kids watching the show in the school auditorium magical and touching. Go Go Donny and I hope to see you in Salt Lake city again.
__label__1 Can we say "overproduced"?: I agree wholeheartedly with Donald-from-Ohio's review. I've been a fan of this Lloyd Weber/Rice musical for 20+ years and have seen it grow as songs were added and various recordings made available. Having never had the opportunity to see the stage production, I was eager to see this video. Now I realize that perhaps this musical is one to be heard and not seen, at least not beyond an unpretentious summer camp or youth group presentation, the perfect venues for this show. Yes, Osmond performs nicely in the role of Joseph. But everything else about this production is so overdone that watching it, for me, is like seeing a favorite childhood friend grow up to become a cheap circus performer. The two stars I give this video are for the music itself. But I certainly don't understand why Lloyd Weber chose to add the FINALE song "Any Dream Will Do" to the BEGINNING of the show.
__label__1 Not for Children: Donny Osmond was wonderful as always, the female lead was not as strong as the CD. This video is not for children. The costumes in the Pharoah's scene are offensive and in poor taste.
__label__2 Joseph and the Amazing Tecno Dreamcoat is the best!: I have wanted to see this musical for the last year, and was overjoyed when I heard that 'Great Performances' would be showing it on April 5th. After a gruling two weeks, the big day came. I watched with unblinking eyes trough the entire show. I thought it was one of the greatest shows I have ever seen on 'Great Performances', apart from 'Cats' of course. If I could give it higher then 5 stars, I would. Though the Mrs. Potiphar's scene I have to admit was a little on the personal side, it didn't really show anything. Her servents costumes were NOT see through, they were just white mesh with extremly small holes between the fabric thread. I would recomond this to anyone that wants to watch and listen to a really upbeat musical that you just have to get up and dance to. If I could find it on video around my town and if I had the money to buy it, I would.
__label__2 The whole family enjoys it!: I saw Joseph for the first time about 4 years ago, and wondered why I waited so long to see it. I took my older children (then aged 8 & 9) to see it two years later--they loved it, too! They insisted I buy the soundtrack CD (also an awesome thing to have), and now my three year old bops around the house singing, "Go, go, go Joseph!" Good music, great lyrics, a great evening for the entire family! A must for Andrew Lloyd Weber fans of all ages.
__label__2 Eye-opening version... Re-orchestrated?: This is a superb visualisation of the show based on the early 90's London Revival with Jason Donovan and (subsequently) Philip Schofield. The production was then moved to the US where Donny Osmond took the title role for 6 or 7 years. This version owes a lot to the original London Revival production. The Canaan sets and the Pharoah sets are practically identical to those of the stage version, just fleshed out a bit. The jail and Potiphar's offices are a new departure, with a triangular theme in black, white and silver. What impressed me the most, though, was the huge involvement of the chorus in this production. The chorus work also seems to have been augmented, with additional harmony lines and dances. All in all, a reaffirmation of the stage as a medium, even in video form! Enjoy!
__label__2 Amazing Things About Joseph: This movie was amazing! I've seen the play and own the CD, and this was by far better. The cast has so much fun with their roles that the audience can't help but enjoy the performance. Donnie Osmond was made for this role, and Maria Friedman shines as the Narrator. I saw another review that said this was racy and distasteful for children, but I found it no more inappropriate than the live performance, and the scenes in question are over so fast, children will hardly have time to question it. I think it's great for the whole family, musical-lovers and nonmusical-lovers alike! I expected it to be the taping of a live performance, and was dreading the poor quality that is unavoidable in such cases, like extreme facial closeups, and bad lighting. What a surprise this was! It was nothing like I expected, and better than I hoped!
__label__1 Buy the soundtrack instead.: Joseph lovers; you will be disappointed with this film. Family viewing it is not. Potiphar's wife and her servants are definitely R rated, and you may be embarrassed to watch this with your children. The narrator is breathy and sexy, which may work in some venues, but not when she is narrating a Bible story to a grade school assembly. Rent it and get it over with, but you'll probably grate at the slow musical pace.
__label__2 I really like: the story being told. The actors are pretty good and they can definitely sing. The biggest reason I purchased this DVD is the singing.
__label__2 A must have for aspiring colorists and lettering: This is by far the most informative book I have come across for lettering and coloring comics. it gives you step by step instructions on how to scan your art, prep it in photoshop, color it, letter it and finally the clean up process. heck, it even goes into how to submit it to the publisher. it also gives non step by step info on things such as color theory and the use of photoshop filters. WAY better than any Marvel book i've read so far.
__label__1 Okay but short of expectations: I got this book to accelerate my knowledge, but I decided that it s not as good as other books of the same kind. Namely, Hi-Fi Guide to coloring Comics, and the lettering book by Comicraft. I got this book because its a book about DC comics, my personal favorites, and I thought I would get better direction on how to "do these things like they do" Sadly this just isnt the case. The direction is just a skimming off the top and gives great history, but actually I have yet to find anything helpful in it. The Comicraft lettering book gives you step by step in Illustrator; and once you learn it it sticks in your mind. Simple as that. The hi fi book, gives instruction and comes with hady texture maps to give your colors more appeal. I would probably recommend this book to younger artists 14 and below. Maybe this was the age bracket it was intended for?
__label__2 Some people...: This was a very funny movie. I saw it awhile back and was just curious as to what other people thought. The guys that gave it 3-5 stars definitely got it right. I was reading the 1-star reviews and just got pissed off. What's wrong with people? What were you expecting from this movie? It was loaded with hilarious scenes. You got these clowns bad mouthing the movie I suppose because I guess it wasn't a groundbreaking thought provoking movie. Get out of your own asses
__label__2 Much Respect: If you thought Bleed's debut was hot, your gonna get roasted to this. "My Own" has a different sound than his first record, but that's what makes it great. He uses lots of samples from the 70's giving it southernplayalistic style that's unmatched. The message conveyed through his lyrics is more than just a mission about money and cheese and thuggin'. Ghetto celebrities Too Short and Daz found their way onto this record, but they are an afterthought. The narcotic effect of Bleed's southern drawl and story telling ability that spawned his first record just accelerates on My Own. Get this if you want to "listen" to a message, not just "hear" words.
__label__1 Stuff is great but don't buy here: Cha Cha Mix is definitely tasty, but don't buy it in bulk here because it turns rancid and you can't return food to Amazon. The first few bags were super but bag five, which was still in code, tasted nasty, as did bag six. I didn't open any more and contacted Harmony and they sent me a coupon for a free bag but that doesn't make up for the eight yucky ones I'm stuck with.
__label__2 Awesome.... for the year that it was made: Texas Chainsaw Massacre is a very good movie... What really got me was the fact that it was based on a true story. TCM#1 was the best out of all of them. #4 was the Lamest of all of them...but opinions vary.
__label__1 The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (Blu-ray): I was very excited to see that the movie arrived within a couple of days of purchase. However, I was not able to watch the movie for almost a month later due to our remodling of our living room witch houses our surround sound and tv. The blu-ray is just a copy of the dvd that came out a few years ago, but I was fine with that since I did not own the dvd. The movie was awesome and still scary just as i remembered it since i last saw it when i was a teen. To my great excitement came sadness when I wanted to see the special features and they did not work!!!!! I cliked on them over and over and nothing, it just brought me back to the main screen again and again. I don't know if this has happened to anybody else, or is my copy a dud.
__label__2 THIS is horror!: No matter how many times I've watched this movie, I'm scared sh**less. I love movies that can scare me even after watching them a million times.Watching all the extras on the DVD didn't help, either. I watched all the Deleted Scenes, the Bloopers, even put an alternative soundtrack on the movie (with Gunnar Hanson, Tobe Hooper, and a production designer narrating) and it still scares me.Oh, I can handle my horror but The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is one of those films that stays with you and refuses to leave. Today's sick jokes of horror films have nothing on Tobe Hooper, Wes Craven, Dario Argento, or the rest of the horror masters.
__label__2 THE SAW IS FAMILY.: I remember when i was about ten watching this movie the one thought i couldn't get out of my mind is that this [stuff] really happend. From the moment that creepy guy jumps in there van and starts talking about how he worked in a slaughter house and then starts cuttin on his self the movie has your attention. I really dont know what else to say that hasn't allready been said so i just want to say love this DVD. 5/5.
__label__1 Widescreen yes, anamorphic, No.: This is great if you have a 27 inch 4:3 Cathode Ray TV but if you have a 16:9 HDTV, beware, it will look terrible.Yes, the "supervised by Tobe Hooper" picture is great, on a small screen but the DVD is in 4:3 Letterbox not 16:9 Anamorphic so you have to "zoom" it to watch on an HDTV and it will look terrible. It's like putting in an old VHS cassette, one that's really deteriorated.I am waiting, anxiously, for a real widescreen version for the modern HDTV audience.
__label__2 so scary: im young and this movies scared me for years i never have gone or looked at any supodley abandod houses very creepy a true horror film.
__label__2 Absolutely terrifying: I skipped this one during its drive-in days, but I caught up with it on video in the 80s. I was so primed to be scared that I watched it on a sunny Saturday afternoon with all the lights on. And it STILL scared the bejesus out of me. You'd be surprised by how little gore there actually is and by how willing Hooper is to sustain the length of a scene until you think you'll leap out of your skin with anxiety. The final shot against the rising sun is maybe my pick for the most memorable of any horror film. It seemed to sum up everything that went before plus make you (a) rethink it while you're (b) not sleeping that night.
__label__2 Good, but sometimes disturbing: THIS is a HORROR movie. In the same vein as "Last house on the left". Well directed and not for sissy horror fans that think "Scream" is the first slasher film. Yeah thats a "good" movie. But, if ya think "that" movie contains the same if not "equal" shock value, you need to crawl out of your hole and rent or buy this movie and see what has been stolen{ from such a fine director}.The acting is so amateur that it works in both the comedic range and the serious.The makeup is incredibly real, so that if it had been done in black and white, the film would have been just as effective. And the camerawork, nothing less than brilliant. It's up there with "Psycho" the original [Hitchcock] as well as the remake [Gus Van Sandt] This is real Hideyoureyes terror.Made to be "Watched Alone" in the dark.In the daylight as well.Beware the Meathook
__label__2 The Greatest Horror film of all time !: Tobe Hooper's 1974 landmark masterpiece debut "THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE" is by far the single most influential horror film of all time. This is the holy grail of horror movies! When i was a kid this movie changed my life,i've been a horror movie addict ever since! This film is the ultimate blue-print on how to make a great horror movie. There are many films that contain much more blood & gore then T.C.M. & to the eye of the beholder there may even be films out there that are more scary then T.C.M.(maybe!?!?) but what makes this film numero uno of all horror films is simpley the amount of influence it has contributed to the horror world & its this reason & this reason alone that "TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE" is the best there was,the best there is & the best there ever will be!
__label__1 DUMB DUMB AND DUMB: this is by far the worse horror movie ever. the acting is pATHETIC, THE KILLER IS A total idiot, the camera footage suckz and theres no story line that goes with it, itz just about a guy that kills people with a chainsaw. i rented this movie and instantly regreted it. PLEAZE do not DO NOT buy this movie and if u do yer screwed
__label__1 Mt Great-Great Uncle: I only bought this because my Great-great uncle, Ross Santee, was featured in it for about 15 seconds. The video was made in 1939, when color had just come out, and the quality of the color is awful. Shadows in people's faces are green. The story line is so basic any kid could predict the ending. Still, it was well worth $10 for me to have a tiny bit of memorabilia of my long-distant family member.
__label__1 Despite great acting by De Niro, this movie sucks.: Let me start by saying that I had high hopes for this film. Some people praise it like it's as good as Taxi Driver. After watching it though, I have no clue what people see in this movie. It drags on and on and at some points of the film (espcially the middle) you really have no idea what is going on anymore. I almost felt like shutting it off a few times, but luckily De Niro's acting kept me from hitting the stop button.I'm sure when this movie came out it was shocking and disturbing, since there wasn't much like it back then. However, by today's standards it really falls flat on it's face. I would not recommend this film to anyone, although if you're really curious about it feel free to give it a try. Obviously there are those who like really bizarre pointless movies like this. Just don't say I didn't warn you!
__label__1 All Star Cast.....But...: I saw this movie in my local video store, and I got excited. I saw huge names (Keitel, De Niro, Scorsese, what would YOU expect?) So I got home, called a couple of friends over, and we sat and watched this movie.This was possibly the most disappointing movie of all time. I'm not kidding at all. I seriously felt dumber after watching this movie; there was absolutely no plot. I don't know how all these people are prancing around calling it "one of the greatest hits of the '70s!" No.Keep in mind, I'm a HUGE Keitel, as well as De Niro fan. I was so disappointed with this movie; but the problem was, there was absolutely no plot, and no transition. The actors played their characters well, but there was no room for characters in the movie. It was a huge upset; 'travesty' does not do this movie justice. No plot, no culmination, no action, no transition, no STORY. Period.
__label__2 Top Notch: This film is shot well, has a great soundtrack, and is definitely a great early piece by Scorsese. There's no real obvious plot line, but it's still a fun movie.
__label__2 Great!: When I was a little kid. I would try to watch these movies but they really freaked me out. Now that im 15 I had to give this one a try. Freddy's Dead was on television and once I saw one part with Freddy and Carlos(Carlo's ear) it freaked me out, but now I watched the whole movie of this and I have to buy the 8 disc box collection. I just special ordered it. This movie was really good. I can't wait to see all the other movies even that one part in Nightmare 6 with Carlos. Maybe this time I don't think it would be as bad, but I think everyone should give this movie a try. Wes Craven is very creative. I've seen his other work like Wishmaster 1-4 and he's done pretty good job. Check this one out!
__label__1 this is not a good movie: If your a die hard fan and saw them all, you may like it, otherwise be warned. It's not good, the twisting of reality with Robert Englund appearing as himself, and Wes Craven's cameo just didn't add the renewal of life that they had hoped. It's not really scary either, which I thought was kind of a requirement in these horror movies.
__label__1 What was the point of this????: Talk about beating a dead horse. How much further can the Freddy thing get stretched? The idea of a character from the movies 'becoming real because he was so evil' is ludicrous at best. It would be like walking into 7-11 and bumping into Darth Vadar as you were filling up your Big Gulp. Robert Englund was happy to make this I'm sure, I mean after awhile people started calling him Freddy everywhere he went. What else was he gonna do, make Cereal or Laundry Soap commercials? Stick with the original series, this was stupid.
__label__2 "He's Back!": Three years after the apparent death of the striped sweater wearing madman, original creator Wes Craven comes back to bring more fear to Elm Street! But this time, the terror doesn't stop at the screen. This is a movie inside of a movie. Freddy's coming into reality because the movies have ended. I love the return of the original cast members,i love the Freddy character in this movie more than i have since Part 4 because he's actually kind of frigtening again,and i think that the story is well executed. I commend you Wes Craven! But on a sad note, i miss the old Freddy look and i most certainly miss the "what the hell?" reaction i got watching the originals. Reality sort of complicates things. But hey, i like the movie... alot.
__label__2 good: this is a really great movie it might even be the best in the series even if the first one in like this classic.
__label__2 Queen of Hell: I only saw about a third of this movie, but i thought it rocked. And i think Freddy oughtta get a girl, just not Heather, as that one guy suggested. Anyway, my question is, how can a kid sleepwalk with his eyes open if he's completely aware of what's going on around him? Maybe i'm misintrepreting, but i saw this movie when i was nine, four years ago, and i recall Dylan sleepwalking into the middle of the street on his way home from the hospital, and Kreuger grabbing him from the sky. The kid was wide awake, so how the heck did Kreuger do it? I mightta missed something, though. I loved the movie, and i'm gonna work on that whole Bride of Kreuger idea this one guy had. Buh-bye.
__label__2 Re-Discover Your Music Collection!: This is a fantastic product! I am NOT a "technical" guy, so I was a bit apprehensive when I ordered the CD Songwriter. Was I happily surprised! I took it out of the box, read the easy-to-follow directions, plugged it in and---immediately---I was rocking the house with LP's and cassettes I literally hadn't heard in years.The CD player and radio are likewise terrific---simple to use and the sound is great. Burning CD's (use blank CD-R's, not CD-RW's) is also a snap. A Rick Springfield cassette I bought in 1985 sounds brand-new burned onto CD with the Crosley Songwriter. A Dylan Thomas poetry album my mom bought in the 1950s likewise sounds crystal-clear on a newly-burned CD.I am so pleased with this Songwriter, I feel like a kid on Christmas morning! Baby Boomers & Gen-X'ers, treat yourselves to this wonderful machine and rediscover your music collection!
__label__2 National Geographic "Africa" Series: Beautifully photographed. However, if you're interested in Africa from a political and historical standpoint, as I am, this is not really the video series for you.Excellent wildlife and nature footage (just as you'd expect from National Geographic) and even an attempt to convey some sociological lessons about "urban" vs. "tribal" differences.Overall, well worth watching, but don't look to it for very deep historical or political enlightenment about the continent.
__label__2 If this CD doesn't perk you up, you're dead: A fun CD from beginning to end. Starts out with the radio hit "Zoot Suit Riot", a very catchy tune with plenty of brasswork that doesn't sound too serious or too contrived. The lyrics reflect the swing-era roots but contain modern phrases and topics (some a little risque). Very tight execution of the genre, every song has a little hook or element that is straight from the swing era. The lyrics are clever and descriptive with a lot of detail. A good CD for either serious headphone listening or to just put on in the background.
__label__2 Damm Good Swing Cd.: This is a damm good swing cd. Don't listen to the other reviews saying that its Ska. There are only traces of Ska in tracks such as Dr Bones, and Pink Elephant. The band is excellent but they do have a habit of adding extra horns and a piano player don't get me wrong these sound great but it makes me wonder if they would sound as good live. As for the lyrics some may find them offensive but in that case don't buy the cd. My opinion? I thought that the lyrics fitted in well with the songs and the style of music. If you like Neo Swing and bands such as Big Bad Voodoo Daddy and Royal Crown Revue then this cd is defiantly for you.
__label__1 You call this swing?: Listen up all you people who think you know swing. This ain't nothin'! This isn't swing, this is something I don't know with a name attached to it. You want some REAL swing try the classics, the real thing, like Benny Goodman, Glenn Miller, Gene Krupa, Artie Shaw, listen to them! the real thing! This is just a modern excuse for music.
__label__2 This cd will make you want to get up and swing dance.: The songs are full of catchy phrases and brilliantly made. The Cherry Poppin' Daddies picked all the right hits to be on the album especially my favorite, Zoot Suit Riot.
__label__2 Zoot Suit Riot is the best song on the album.: This album is pretty good...not as good as I had hoped. Zoot Suit Riot is definitely the greatest song on the album, other ones like "Come Back to Me" are also good. But it doesn't live up to the expectations I had. Overall a good album, but not perfect.
__label__1 Wasn't very impressed, especially after all the hype.: I bought this cd after hearing the title song for the hundreth time on the radio, thinking maybe the whole cd would be as good. Boy, was I wrong. I would return it if Amazon would take an opened cd back!
__label__2 THE best album of 1998. Period.: The CPD's are by far the best band alive in America today. "Zoot Suit" is the best CD of the year. On stage, I have never seen a band more charged and on fire than the CPD's. All other swing is boring lounge music compared to Zoot Suit. Steve Perry is one of the top three lyric writers on my personal list, making their music all the more enjoyable. The lyrics are complex, intelligent, morally pointed, and clever. The music is rich, catchy, diverse, and incorporates more instruments than other swing bands. The CPD's are definitely not smooth and syrupy like other bland bands. They have the same demented, spastic gusto they started out with years ago, and are only going to get hotter. All other bands, including the "masters" of days-gone-by swing (with all due respect, of course), are left foundering in the wake of the CPD's.
__label__2 oh yeah: with the great beat good lyrics and skilled players they are simply the best, the worst complaint ive heard is that you got to know a little about the 30's to get the lyrics, mista-s
__label__1 Awful stuff: I agree with the two previous reviewers. This is indeed horrendous fake swing that doesn't hold a candle to the original masters. It is also GRATE (not great) modern swing!
__label__1 Swinging and Swearing Don't Mix: These losers have a brain-dead idea. They trot out the old Swing/Jump sound of the '30s, then figure that in order to update it for the '90s, they'd better add some downer lyrics and foul language. This is the modern '90s idea of fun, I guess.No thanks. If I want to listen to Swing, I'll stick with the original masters. Do yourself a favor and buy a Duke Ellington, Fletcher Henderson, or even a Louis Prima CD, and you'll see how lame these neo-Swing pretenders are.
__label__1 There's much better modern swing out there...: The swingin' sounds on this may rock, but the swingin' words on Zoot Suit Riot are simply awful. Abuse and swing just don't go together... this stuff is supposed to be FUN, not miserable. Go listen to the Squirrel Nut Zippers or Brian Setzer Orchestra instead.
__label__2 Absolutely Love Hoku!: I bought Hoku's CD years ago. I didn't even know who she was but I was young and pretty much bought any CD. I am now almost 18, and I still listen to her CD repeatedly. I know every word to every song. I noticed that someone reviewed her song " Another Dumb Blonde" with bad feedback. That person does not know music. Hoku's music is about love and how a girl can overcome a guy. Then she has a song about someone being there for her always, through thick and thin. "You Frist Believed" Is my all-time favorite. Its a touching song and reminded me of someone I know. If I had one last wish before I died, it would be to meet Hoku and her father, Don Ho. She is incredibly beautiful, and very talented. I have done kareoke many times, and most of which I was singing her songs. I am, without a doubt, Hoku's number 1 fan!!!! I love you Hoku!!!!!Amanda
__label__1 Hoku is a hit... with children five and under that is!: Hoku's ridicousily stupid "Another Dumb Blonde" is possibly one of the stupidest songs ever writen. Hoku didn't even write the song and the melody and lyrics are horid. Hoku is no small package thoiugh- she's two doughnuts away from 200. The title alone states perfectly what she is- another dumb blonde.
__label__1 Another dumb blonde: Although she might say she's not,it's painfully obvious.Hoku is "another dumb blond". The only reason she gets those 5-star reviews is cuz people are so tired of dumb blond singers that they want to believe thet she's different.She danses like a moose.
__label__2 Great CD!: Excellent music that carries a fantasic sense of Place. To my knowledge, Kyle Thompson is the only musician ever to record Civil War-era music ON LOCATION at different battlefields. Thompson is a talented musician and the fact that he had been diagnosed with Lou Gherig's disease by the time of the recording (something I found out after hearing the CD) just made it that much more poignant. The music on the CD is a balanced mix of lighter and darker music. The joy and humor come through in the upbeat songs while the tragedy and sadness of the War comes through the solemn pieces in a way that more glib, nauseously cheery musicians would never be able to communicate.
__label__2 still the best: This album is awesome. I love the song Dive. This song kinda reminds me one of the songs that I used to sing in my church youth group. He always sings how a true christian (or should I say disciple) should feel. Especially in the song The Change. I saw him in concert in California. I was sixteen years old. The feeling that I had while I was at that concert was the best. I own all his albums. He never disapoints me. He is the main reason I listen to Christain music.
__label__1 Building the Custom Home Office: This has to be the worst book I have ever seen on the subject. 154 pages dealing with ONE home office layout/concept. AND this is from 2002. Very difficult to get ideas as it deals with one outdated office concept and explains how to build the components from scratch. In this day and age most components can be bought it is the ideas that are needed. Useless book. Don't know how it had over 4 stars when I bought it.
__label__2 A cornerstone in brass-band funk: I first got this album in 1992. I was immediately hooked. This album is a cornerstone of music that the dirty dozen brass band have helped bring back to the spotlight. One of my all time favorites.
__label__2 Korean movie The Great Queen Seondeok: Great movie. Well directed and true historic account of the life of the Queen. Great action and plot. Not like some of those cheap Chinese movies.
__label__1 the great queen seondeok: the story line is perfect the cast and choreogophy are great but the dvd's suck out of the first 20 chapters only 5 have had no problems and i lost have of the story line
__label__2 Writers, You Need This Book: Whether you are a beginning writer or an established author, this book gives solid advice. I love how you can read the book from cover to cover or just flip to a section that you want to know about right now. Keep it handy and reference it often.Karen Reddick, author of Grammar Done Right!
__label__1 their lesbian schtick is running thin: god, this music is soooo annoying! and didn't Britney already do the schoolgirl thing? they can only kiss each other while performing so many times before everyone gets tired of it.boring.
__label__2 THE MOST ENJOYABLE ALBUM OF ALL TIME!!!!!!!!!!: This has to be one of the most amazing cd's ever! Britney Spears only wishes she could make music like this. Great pop beats with meaningful lyrics align all the songs here.Coming from someone who loves Madonna, Stevie Nicks, Michael Jackson. This is one of my favorite cd's of all time. I absolutley love each song to pieces.The album is very dark pop/electro, and it's enhoyable from start to finishMy favorite songs are How soon is Now, Stars, 30 minutes, and of course the classic Not Gonna Get Us, and All the Things she Said.BUY THIS ALBUM!!!!You have to listen to it! it's phenomenal!!
__label__2 Tatu - Russian Music comes to the USA: Folks,For several years, the Russian music scene has exploded with a wealth of talent. Tatu is not the best Russian group, but they are pretty good, their music is very catchy. And...if you listen to the Russian versions, they're even more hypnotic.\According to people in Russia, Tatu is a kids band, a little 2nd rate, but what the heck, the songs are great, good melodies...I sing to them! My only problem is I heard them first as Russian songs, now they have been transformed into English!Perhaps someday the USA will be graced by even better artists, like Alsou Safina, someone who is a serious singer and can sing extrememly well.
__label__2 These girls are definetely gonna get you!: Talk about amazing. These girls are definetely worth listening to. A couple months ago my friend talked me into downloading one of their songs. I caved in and did so. I listened to just a little clip of them, and I was immediately hooked. These girls have amazing voices, and you can definetely tell their heart and souls are in their music. I also think it's awesome that they are open about their sexuality. These girls aren't ashamed, and I believe that's awesome! These girls have awesome tracks like "All the things she said" a nice cover of "How soon is now", and one of my favs "Malchik Gay". If you feel like putting yourself in a good mood, and feel like dancing, then I definetely recommend this CD! Get them now, it's well worth it!
__label__1 Not worth it - taped @ extended/super-long play & inaudible.: Inaudible particularly for Gollum's talking and some of the songs. Glitches appear in the taping including soem sections where the sound drops off for a second in the middle of a sentence. Not re-digitized. Not worth it. Perhaps other reviews refer to a different version of the movie.
__label__1 didn't see it yet but not buying it: It is not fair to call this a "review" because I have not watched the DVD. Due to having seen several reviews here and on other websites regarding the lack of good audio and the sadly recrafted movie, I refuse to buy it. I LOVE The Hobbit from my childhood. I have been searching for months for the movie in DVD for my kids and after reading several reviews, I know myself well enough to choose to avoid the deep disappointment that others have related about this particular DVD. I just want the same movie I watched as a kid on a DVD. Is that too much to ask?
__label__1 Great cartoon, horrible quality: This cartoon was one of my favorites when I was a kid. So now that I've got kids of my own I bought a DVD copy to watch with them. Unfortunately, the DVD is the worst analog to digital transfer I've ever seen. It has a very flat appearance, the colors are lifeless, not vivid like the original. They should fire the guy who made this DVD version. It looks like a cheap bootleg, maybe even worse. Don't buy this DVD until they re-release it with a proper analog to digital transfer. Also, I think they edited parts out of the original cartoon. I rarely ever rate anything on Amazon, but this is so bad I felt like I had to warn other people. If you've still got a VHS player, the VHS version of the film looks great.
__label__1 over-whelmed with a sense of its own importance: seeing this film successfully kept me from reading anything by tolkien for over ten years. after i had read "the hobbit," i was able to watch it and laugh more often than i felt appaled.the film lacks the quiet dignity of the book and feels heavy-handed. watching it i could only think of the phrase, "bilbo gump." the progress the character of bilbo makes in the book is lost in film and we are left with a hero who wanders through his various adventures, which apparently have very little effect on anything aside from his financial situation. and as an extra side-note, the music feels ridiculous.
__label__1 Missing sounds... how annoying: For the first time in my life, I wish I had a VHS copy even with the DVD released. I first noticed a problem when the first spider dies in the movie, and there is no vortex sound effect. Then the entire scene in Lake Town is... muted. The arrows are silenced, the dragon roars as a mouse, and the fire, it crackles as a loud annoyance. I wish I had read the reviews online prior to purchasing, now I am stuck with a poor quality DVD. I will be buying the VHS shortly.
__label__1 The DVD sound is TOTALLY unacceptable: The DVD omits _all_ ambient noise in the movie, including Smaug's fire, his whooshing noise over the village, the arrows plinking, wolves howling, etc. It is very disturbing to those who are familiar with the video version, and if I could I would ask for my money back.
__label__1 MOIVES ON PARADE! DO NOT ORDER-ITS WORST COPY OF HOBBIT: I have seen this moive over 1000 times and thats no exageration! being born in 1972 I remember this film in the theatres and has been a favorite ever since and is a FAMILY FAVORITE with my kids today.This "THE HOBBIT:THE ORIGINAL UNEDITED 1977 ANIMATED CLASSIC" as advertised it a complete lie, the film is edited and missing scences,not whole scences mind but enough to make it seem it was chopped to be compadible for T.V. and its commercials to fit in a time slot, not only that the colar is quite faded and not sure if it is due to a poor quality DVD that the moive was downloaded/recorded on but there is a glich, a repeator skip of 1.5 second as Bilbo spaeks to Gandalf and others....I will never order on Amazon again, HOW CAN THEY CALL IT THE ORIGINAL UNEDITED CLASSIC WHEN IT IS NOT!SAVE YOUR MONEY FOR THE REAL VERSION!!!
__label__2 Great version of J.R.R. Tolkein's The Hobbit.: Bilbo Baggins ( voiced by " Orson Bean") is a Hobbit that goes on a simple quest with Gandolf ( John Huston) and a bunch of Dwarfs that must find Gold from the evil Dragon " Smaug". A highly entertaining and all-around fun yet excellent Rankin-Bassfilm which is one of the best they did with " Return of the King", " The Last Unicorn", and " Flight of Dragons".Also recommend: Lord of the Rings ( 1978), Return of the King,and Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Rings.
__label__1 TERRIBLE DVD Sound - Avoid the DVD!!: Whether you like the original movie or not, the DVD version's soundtrack is missing a very large number of key elements - the majority of the sound effects, ambient sound backgrounds, some of the music, and even the occaisional bit of dialogue. The result is like watching an unfinished movie with a "temp" audio track. A truly horrendous offense for an animated movie, which depends so much on sound. Do NOT buy the DVD - you're not really getting the movie as advertised.
__label__1 Disappointed...: What a bummer. First off, it was late getting here even though it was sent 2-day Prime. So it barely made it for Christmas. The worst part is the poor quality of the DVD. It skipped in SEVERAL places. Brand new out of the case, first time in the player, and it skipped. The quality of the movie is awful too. You'd think if it was that bad to begin with, it wouldn't have been transferred to a DVD to begin with... :/
__label__2 A review- post viewing of the Hobbit: Overall, it was great. I, being a hardcore Tolkien fan, judged the movie with an extremely critical eye. The songs were well done. And the animation was o.k. It really only has one plot conflict,that being that they totally left out Beorn. Oh, yeah , the elves could have been portrayed better. They look like blue ants that got tangled up in the machinery of a textile mill. Gollum was wonderful.
__label__1 Terrible DVD Transfer: My experience has been in line with several others here. Sounds are missing from the original version, some sounds repeat. There are several points where the DVD appears to skip and replay a short sequence that it just played. The colors are extremely poor -the cave scenes are supposed to be darker but here we struggled to actually see anything that was happening. I like the film, but the quality of this transfer is just unacceptable - do not buy.
__label__1 Unwatchable!: The animated Hobbit has for years been one of my all time favorites. Unfortunately, the quality of this DVD is similar to what you would get if you copied a worn VHS tape onto a disk. The movie is so dark in many places you can only see dim shapes moving about. The theme song even has a skip in it and there are a number of other skips in the soundtrack. There are also several places where a second or so of the movie is duplicated and repeated. I have no idea how they messed that up! If i had purchased it locally, i would return it, but i guess i will keep it until they decide to fix this dvd and reissue it, hopefully on a blu-ray. My recommendation is Do Not Purchase this version unless you really cannot live without a copy, any copy.
__label__2 Now thats what I call a bible: Fantastic - it arrived yesterday, 4000 miles to England in under 5 days from ordering - well done Amazon! When I opened it I thought "here at last is the bible I've been looking for for years"!
__label__1 PRINT SIZE IS 6.2 NOT 9.5: I HAD TO RETURN MINE DUE TO INACCURATE DESCRIPTION6.2 IS UNREADABLE FOR ME
__label__2 Perfect-sized Bible: I bought this Bible as a gift, and I was completely thrilled with it. It is small enough to carry with you but large enough for at home study. The print was larger than I expected, and the pages were not too thin. The cover work was very nicely done; my friend was very pleased with this Bible!
__label__1 Caution before downloading: The Kindle Touch version has been problematic for me. I can find no Table of Contents, and no listing for the all important abbreviation needed for "this book." I appreciate that the download was free, now I know why. Discouraged.
__label__1 Tiny Font: I bought the ESV single column legacy imitation leather Bible based on the stated font size of 9 points. When I received the Bible I could barely read the text even with reading glasses. I could not read the even smaller footnotes.I measured the capital letters and found them to be 0.090 inch high. According to Wikipedia the current font standard is 1 point = 1/72 inch. That should make a 9 point font 0.125 inch high. Even the old font standard has the 9 point font in the 0.125 inch range.Other than the font the Bible seems to have good quality. Use of the very large margins should allow the publisher to use a full 9 point font without increasing the page count.The Bible was promptly returned.
__label__2 Good, cheap Bible for travel: No footnotes or references, just your basic Bible. It's nice and small but still readable. Fits right in my purse. The only complaint I have is that I left it in my Jeep during the summer and the cover curled up pretty bad but not bad for the price.
__label__2 Great for Gifts!: Super handy and looks legit, even though it's TruTone! And because it's less than $10, it makes great gifts! I've bought quite a few just to give away to my fellow church-goers!
__label__1 Too long: The book is too long and contains some unnecessary kill-crazy parts. Certainly good for historical reference but I wouldn't reccomend this as a source of spiritual or even moral inspiration.
__label__2 Yamaha ipod dock: Easy to connect, GUI display is clear and easily readable from a distance, and the remote of my Yamaha RX-V2700 is responsive. You can select the option to charge as well. You have to enable video output to see the video on another monitor.The only thing it DOES NOT seem to do, is to go the next level up from music i.e. video, photos (via the remote). You can manually watch video/photos (if you have those features on your ipod) by physically using the click-wheel and then you can stop/start the video with the remote. That last shortcoming prevents it from attaining a "5".
__label__1 Still have not received it: I have not yet received this camera ordered at beginning of September, my emails to mike@nextpower.com are bounced back to me, and I cannot find a way to contact Amazon regarding this item...so I guess I am just out the money sent.
__label__1 Could have been better.: I'm sorry to say I read about half of it until I gave up and skipped to the end and partially read the last chapter.I dont know what it was about the book that just didn't keep me hooked. Thankfully I got it from the library so it didn't cost me anything.Hopefully Sigaloff's next book will entertain me more.
__label__1 This film had a point to make, but we lose interest right..: from the beginning. Because the film is so boring, we don't really care to know what the point was.ASH WEDNESDAY is about a middle-aged woman, who is undergoing a middle-age crisis, elememts of which include her having an extensive plastic surgery and a young lover. It is a "we have to value what we've got" sort of thing.Except for the great Henry Fonda, who appears only in couple of scenes, all actors are complete ham. I did not feel any genuine emotion coming from the screen, I didn't laugh, and I was not entertained. On my list, these are the characteristics of a bad movie. I am sorry to hurt the feelings of all die-hard Elizabeth Taylor fans: she is a true star, but even her costumes could not save this film. It is dull and pretentious!
__label__2 Great Remote Mount Radio: This radio has the same features that most $300+ radios have, yet it's less than $100. The full channel scanning and DualWatch work great and to be such a compact unit with such a small speaker the audio sounds good. If you will be driving with the windows down go ahead and plan for an external speaker but for any other time the built in speaker works great. Once setup with a tuned antenna the transmit and receive are both great. A great radio for a great value!
__label__2 Inspired movie!: I saw this movie on TBN channel last night and it was good. To the previous reviewer and anyone who is interested, you can get this movie in DVD format from World Wide Pictures homepage (http://shop.wwp.org). I'm going to order one from there today.
__label__2 Can I give it 10 STARS? Repin' HARLEM to the Fullest: This is a remarkable book. Mr.Thomas you did your thang! This is the first real grown- up book I read back in 1995. I was sooo open I wanted to know everything that happened next. Piri was Wild! And knowing that this is an autobiography it's even more exciting. I love the way he represented the areas I've lived in or even went to school in. Piri told life how it really was and how it took him to learn about it. Growing up in Spanish Harlem put me on to a lot of Hispanics denying their African culture. It's true how some parents like Piri had act the same way as they did.I had the pleasure of meeting Piri Thomas at my school in Spanish Harlem also it was remarkable to picture such a character then really see him face to face although he was much much older. But it was still amazing. This book is Raw and it an absolute page turner let me tell you from a young Black teenager in Harlem THIS IS A VERY GOOD BOOK, AN ABSOLUTE PAGE TURNER!
__label__1 Encounter With Alien Man: I would not recommend "Space Aliens Took Me To Their Planet" to those who disbelieve that the earth is being visited by spaceships (piloted by god-like people) because this book depicts such an encounter that took place in 1973 in France. ======= The book's emphasis is upon the alien's extensive message concerning mankind's origins, mankind's religions, mankind's future, etc. ======= If I were to only judge the insights that this book provides into the awesome technology and power exhibited by aliens, a well as the awesome influence that aliens can wield upon human beings, I would have to give the highest rating available (five stars). However, I will only give this book one star because another book, entitled "The Sacred And The Profane", written by Desiree Ntolo (published in 2008 and available from Amazon.com), exposes the dangerously evil intentions that form the basis of the alien's message.
__label__1 you gotta know when to fold em Kenny: Ugh! Kenny Rogers doing a Whitney Houston ballad? He doesn't have the voice for any of these songs. Stick to what you know Kenny.
__label__1 Short Summary: These guys look like a couple of crackheads (especially the one on the left). Sad how they are being paid for this garbage. I guess a Jr. High School diploma and knowing your drugs gets you far in the ATL. Enjoy being rich and ignorant.
__label__1 Breathtaking cinematography, invasive music, 1 hour too long: One of the most beautifully filmed movies in recent years. The beauty of the images is about all there is to recommend here. The manipulative music is far too loud and sappy. Ethan Hawke is a robot. Scott Hicks commentary is one of the most boring on any DVD. Far too long, the only thing keeping your finger from the fast forward button are the images themselves.
__label__1 Basically "To Kill A Mockingbird" With Different Ethnicity: Would have given it a 1-star, but the production values were gorgeous (cinematography, music score, sound, set decoration.) However, very hard to follow with numerous flashbacks in flashbacks (I think.) I didn't read the book so I didn't know the story, but the author seems to have channeled another famous book. All the actors seemed put out to have shown up without any intrest in fleshing out their chracters, no chemistry inter-play with any of the characters. Slowwwwwwww..........
__label__1 Impassioned Drudgery: This movie, though it tells a compelling story, it simply filled with drudgery. I have not read the book, and still may, but I also consider the story line to be absolutely full of a race-baiting mentality. I do not recommend "Snow Falling on Cedars."
__label__1 nibbling on kelp: Snow falling on ceders has all the warmth and cheer of the wet, dismal, cold and foggy weather of the region. Utterly depressing.The plot is plodding and stale. No surprises.None of the characters can one identify or sympathise with. That every group is bigoted is nothing new.The ending not worth waiting for.Scenery is lovely as usual but the only redeeming feature of this film is that it portrays the region as it was that began dying out as I was born. The lumber industry and fishing are no longer what they once were. The ferry boats and strawberry fields are still there but tourism is now the biggy.
__label__2 Blu ray please!: I really enjoy this movie, I haven't read the book, but the storyline in the movie is excellent. I would buy this on blu-ray in a heartbeat if it were to become available. My only fault with the movie is that (in my opinion) the "overdubbed voice-overs" (not sure exactly what you call them) toward the end seem a little overbearing.
__label__1 A True Stinker: Cinematography is just ONE ingredient of a good film, not thewhole recipe. This was a story with so much promise, yet it insistedon becoming eye-candy rather than a good movie...... END
__label__1 Great Work Of Fiction: Its a shame this book fails in its promise to expose a conspiracy but it makes for some good fiction. The author seems to feel that FDR was a communist and the reason he allowed Pearl Harbor to be attacked is to spread communisim around the world.I was left confused and bewilderd by Mr. Willey's arguments as most of the evidence presented was taken out of order or mixed and matched to fit his argument.
__label__2 Celica 2002 GTS, no body kit: This fits pretty well, and doesn't stick out off the back very much at all. It does slightly press upwards on my bumper, this could be from a previous accident so I don't want to dock more than one star. Install is a little bit of a pain because of the angle to get the original brackets off, but I did it on my own in a parking lot. I use it to be able to take bikes with me, and still have some space for people/other stuff. I used this bike rack:Allen Deluxe 3-Bike Hitch Mount Rack (1.25 or 2-Inch Receiver)
__label__2 Siberian Chipmunks: Basic Informative book on keeping siberian chipmunks as pets. My used copy was in great condition.Chipmunks
__label__2 attention all TY collectors!!!!!: one of the best toys. low education, but a lot of fun! a best friend for hippity, floppity, and flippity!
__label__2 fantastic!: I love the Cherry Poppin' Daddies...they're the best! Their songs are wonderful and they're sung beautifully.
__label__1 Unable to return miss labled Stearns Rearm Kit: We have five SoSpenders inflatable PFDs model number 38APRO and ordered five rearming kits#0944 which state on the package that they fit the SoSpenders 38APRO PFD. The water sensitive bobbin in the kits does not fit the PFD and when we attempted to return the kits in the original packages to Amazon they would not accept them saying that they can not accept shipping of items that have gas in them. It is strange that they can ship to us items that have gas in it but we can not ship the same product in the original unopened package back to them. Now we are stuck with $120.00 worth of rearm kits that are of no use to us. Our recomendation is DO NOT USE AMAZON as they are a company that does not admit it has a miss labled or improperly packaged product.
__label__2 Algebra: Structure and Method Book 1 (California Edition): No marks that I have found yet. All pages seem to be there. Cover is good. In fact, it hardly looks used.
__label__1 I'm happy my order was canceled: After reading several reviews, I ordered these, but they never arrived and I was reimbursed the purchase price, so I went to a local sporting goods store and compared these to theNikon 10x42 Monarch. After comparing the two, even though the Monarch's were more money. The Monarch 10x42 is a lot better quality Binocular. And I have been very happy with them .
__label__2 GREAT MOVIE: I'm not sure why people have been giving this movie such low ratings. I highly recommend the DVD version. The artistic effects were absolutely brilliant! Although the story tends to drag on at times and the acting could have been better, I believe it is worth watching. I'd rent it before buying it.
__label__1 Not True to History or Joan of Arc: Save your time and money - avoid this movie.I have studied the life of Joan of Arc and was extremely disappointed by this movie. The Messenger portrays Joan as a mental case who was unsure of herself and full of doubts. The record is clear that the real Joan was confident in her faith and in "her voices."Also the movie has many scenes of graphic violence that are purely gratuitous and unnecessary. Yes war is violent but to include scenes of a head exploded by a giant wreaking ball adds nothing.I do not recommend this movie to anyone who is serious about learning about Joan of Arc.Get the 1948 Ingrid Bergman movie - it is much closer to the true story.For the best version of the real story, read Mark Twain's book.This movie is an insult to a young woman who is quite possibly the most remarkable person who ever lived (aside from Jesus).
__label__1 Miscast: This movie was 100% perfect, except Faye Dunaway should have caked some make-up on and played Joan of Arc herself. She has limitless talents and would have brought the movie what is was missing--a truly spiritual heroine. I'm telling you, Faye Dunaway was born to play this part. One can only hope of a re-make, and soon!
__label__1 well.....it was okay: i ran into blockbuster excited to watch this movie. i am a big fan of joan and i like many others had big expectations for the movie. this movie was done the wrong way in many ways possible. who made the idea to have "joan of arc" the savior of the republic of france, to make her into a total lunatic? i know she had a minor case of epilepsy but she's not no EMILY ROSE. (in case you dont know emily rose she was a girl who was a epileptic that was so intence she was supposely possessed by demons.) how can u do such a thing? they made joan so annoying i didnt want to watch it no more. the action was not good at all. u could tell some of the cast of the movie were atheists because they made it look like those signs were not real. those signs were left by GOD and they were not by coincedence. dont bother pick it up and if you do, i doubt u will watch it again. this is the miami reviewer. PEACE.
__label__2 Very historical: This movie combines aspects from the true story of Joan of Ark into a fighting fest and I love it. The battle scenes are nice and gore with blood coming from every part of those peoples bodys. But, it does try to tie history in it. Joan of Ark is potrayed to be a nice warrior. Millia Jovovich is a great actor. This movie got me very interested in Joan of Ark. This is one of my favorite movies ever!
__label__1 The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc: Well as a student of History, this movie is to say the least, pittiful. The acting is so bad some of the fighting sequences are laughable. The young women who plays Joan, should go back to acting school, she only seems to have two levels crazy, and crazy screaming. The only good thing about the film were the sets and costumes.
__label__1 Great music, Bad recording: This session was recorded in Ohio in 1980. I don't know what kind of recording equipment was used, but the sound is terrible!
__label__2 Fantastic Book: A wonderfully written book. A superb plot. Great characters. Interesting setting. A classic. A must read. One of my 10 favorite works of fiction. Maybe even better than Shogun!
__label__1 Never got the book and it's been a month...: I ordered this book for a friend's son's birthday. I have tried to find out why they haven't gotten it and they say it is still in transit... I can't get a straight answer from anybody.
__label__2 My kids love to read this over and over: I have 3 boys, all of them love learning about bugs. It's perfect for my oldest (who doesn't like to be near bugs, but loves learning about them). It's also perfect for my middle and youngest boys, who pick up every and any bugs they can get their hands on. I am so happy we purchased this book (we did a few Christmases ago), and they still love reading it. There are a few every-day bugs in the book, and a lot of exotic and poisonous bugs, which seems to interest my kiddos even more. It's full of large, very detailed photos of each bug that's described. Awesome.
__label__1 not as good as i was hoping: when i considered buying this for my car and started looking at the reviews i knew it was going to be a toss up wether it was going to be a quality product or not, i liked that it had the front firing speaker and the soundtracker system, which the radio i have in my tractor for work(cobra25) also has the soundtracker system and it works great, but when i recieved it and set it up with a 2ft wilson antenna its performance was less then exceptional, radio is very noisy even with the soundtracker system on. this radio constantly freezes(when i turn it on it will be stuck on ch9 and you wont be able to change channels use the weatherband or anything, you have to turn it off and hope for the best next time you turn it on) and the front firing speaker is very quiet. i should have went with another cobra25 and just bought an external speaker
__label__2 Mac cover: I bought this for my buddy. He had looked at one, and he loves it now that he has it! Stylish and functional, what else could you want?
__label__2 Gripping account of long-lasting effects of killing spree.: Author Greg Kelly was 10 years old growing up in Rockford, Ill., when Ray Lee Stewart went on a weeklong killing spree that took 6 lives and shook the community's small-town midwestern roots. Like so many others in Rockford, Greg was terrified until long after Stewart's capture and haunted by his crimes for years afterwards. Fifteen years later as a young newsman working at WGN Television in Chicago, Greg called in sick so he could attend the murderer's clemency hearing. A few weeks later he witnessed the execution. Kelly's vivid description of that eerie evening is alone worth the price of the book, as are the insights into courtroom proceedings, TV reporting, and Kelly's portraits of victims' families and their suffering.
__label__2 The kids loved it!: Stuart Little is one of those nice films that you can drag out on a rainy winters' day, and the kids will watch it despite having seen it lots of times before. The blu-ray quality is very good, and there is nothing in this film which will disturb young children - mine are 5 and 8 and they both enjoy it. Recommended!
__label__1 Charlotte's Web is better! OH MY SWEET TEMPLETON!: CHARLOTTE'S WEB IS BETTER BECAUSE THE MOVIE HAD TEMPLETON IN IT. (TEMPLETON IS MY BOYFRIEND)! SO.. I WANT EVERYONE TO KNOW: "RATS ARE BETTER THAN MICE!" STUART LITTLE IS FOR PEOPLE WHO DON'T FALL IN LOVE WITH THE RAT ON CHARLOTTE'S WEB! IF YOU THINK MY REVIEW IS HELPFUL, E-MAIL ME AT SweetRoxanne@hotmail.com IF YOU THINK IT'S NOT HELPFUL, E-MAIL ME AT Roxanne12@aol.com
__label__2 Adoption message: This is a fun, wholesome movie. It also provides a starting point for discussing adoption with children. Even if children aren't adopted, they will certainly meet others who are. This movie presents adoption in a positive light, an attitude which I believe even young children can begin to emulate.
__label__2 A Sure-Favorite At the Day Care!!: This is one of the Most Requested movies at our Day Care Center and certainly one of my personal favorites!! Everybody in the movie is wonderful....Mr. and Mrs. Little (Geena Davis is really great!!), big brother George, SnowBell, the impostor Mom & Dad Mouse Family, everybody is great, just I really can't stand Stuart that much!! GASP!! Maybe it is just that he is so naive. He jus thinks everybody loves him. Or maybe it is just that he is so stupid as to think that the Little's were so glad to get rid of him they cut his picture out and he believes SnowBell. I know, I know, that is the WHOLE POINT OF THE STORY, but it bothers me a little. So I give 'Stuart Little' 4 Stars, and well, maybe 4 and a Half.
__label__1 suartlittle: they don't talk about funny stuffsthey don't pretend to be dead.They don't go fast with a car.Can't put them to a jail.Can't have a hot rideCan't go full blast with a car
__label__1 not necessarily for kids: My two young children enjoyed watching this movie, but I was very disappointed when I heard the cats swearing. I don't want my children to pick up and mimic that language, thinking that it's cute and fun because it is from this movie. The mice and cats are very cute and well done, but the cursing didn't add anything to what should have been a family show. For cute animals, there are better movies to watch.
__label__1 Too bad no one read the book: This movie called Stuart Little because its title character is a mouse, not because it has anything to do with E.B White's book of the same name. I felt like I was watching a re-telling of "Annie" rather than seeing a film version of a great story. A typical result of creating a giant marketing and merchandising machine.
__label__2 A somewhat entertaining historical account: Given my odd sense of humor, I wasn't suprised that I liked this book. While tragic, the deaths accounted for remind us that when we're dealing with nature, we must deal with it on its own rules. The "pedestrians have the right-of-way" attitude won't cut it out there, folks! Of course some deaths were not the result of the individuals foolishness, but also by accident or bad luck.
__label__1 George b: I see this highly rated and don't understand how that can be, unless screen visibility is of no concern to those reviewers. Look before you buy this one!I'd never recommend this 2610 because of the single issue that the display is unusable in daylight & barely marginal for inside viewing. It's a shame because the sound is good. Maybe that's why AT&T; gives them away free - hoping to get rid of them.
__label__1 Not very good: I'm not a huge fan of Medieval literature, and perhaps this book is to blame. I think I've been spoiled by the Norton and Bevington anthologies I've used in other classes, because this was truly a let-down. If you're a prof looking for a good book to use for class, have your students spend the extra twenty-spot and get a Norton.
__label__2 good: I am very satisfied with the product, it came in a good time and the customer service provided was great.
__label__1 dated...: 'Cheap and cheerful' is how I'd describe this book. Which means there are better, and more up to date, ideas around on how you can manage time and life. I found the ideas dated and the author's style prescriptive.Much better value, highly practical, and with some innovative ideas, is Mark Forster's Get Everything Done (And Still Have Time To Play).
__label__1 okay, but derivative: Lots of interesting examples but too many of them seem to come from a right-wing perspective. Also the book, which is humorless, reminds me of other better-done accounts of the same areas. The lessons of the book should be applied to the book itself. It doesn't fare well if this is done.
__label__1 Complete Waste of time / Film: The premise seemed alluring... saving the world in secret by use of time travel to the future... But nothing makes much sense in this movie. all of The charactors can't think past their nose. What drives them on? oh yeah their unknown B actors getting paid to play in a truly pathectic Sci-Fi... Like most reviewers I tend not to write about somthing that really just sucks, but I had to this time cause this one pissed me off so. I've seen many B-movie Sci-fi's but this one takes the cake. Of all the movies waiting to be transfered to DVD what Exec. Booted this one into production? Must be another groopie friend of Peter Fonda. I thought with Fonda's name attached to it, it couldn't be half bad. But was I wrong!
__label__2 Everything is better with Jello!: Good to hear that there is someone out there that's popular in the clubs......but maintains a message and logic. Unfortuanatly I'm sure most of the fans don't have a clue as to what half there songs are about. Not unlike Dead Prez, Skinny Puppy, Antipop Consortium, Jeru Da Damaja, KRS-ONE etc. Everybody just wants to dance and be......entertained as the world around them falls apart.Anyhow, rants aside this is a very this album, it has a very Motown kind of sound to it though I'm sure that is just synths and not actual instruments.Regardless the M.C. is good, the words hard hittting, and like I say, Jello Biafra from the Dead Kennedys is on it, you can't go wrong!
__label__1 Bad Book!!!: This book was bad..... in organization, setup, explanation, and examples.... If you want a good java book, LEWIS and LOFTUS is great. I regretfully have to buy BIG JAVA another Horstman great for a class. I sure hope its better than this one!
__label__2 Remember children, it's only the concepts.: Calm down, calm down. The title of this book has neither '..in a week', nor '..in 24 hours and certainly not '..while you drive to work' in its title.It teaches you the 'concepts' and 'essentials' of Java programming. It doesn't cover IO in detail nor threads, nor games programming. When you've finished this book then you will be ready to tackle those difficult topics that are well covered by Reilly's animal series. The main theme running through the book is the progressive development of an interactive bank account. I can recommed this book to absolute beginners or those not familiar with object orientated programming.Bonus points go to the first half of the book. Minus points go to coverage of IO.
__label__1 barely useful: Flimsy construction, indoor display is hard to read at most angles, and the remote unit only has a temperature sensor--no hygrometer, which wasn't clear from the product description.
__label__1 Could have been better: I bought this book for the unique spreads and read it thoroughly. I would have liked to see explanations for why the cards are laid out in certain order and places. I thought the questions were too specific and would be difficult to answer with numerous cards. Interesting spreads, good subject matter, not well executed or explained at all. Please rewrite the book, Ms. Abraham and I will buy it again.
__label__2 Great product. UI could be improved: I've had this product for at least six years. I love the functionality. We receive a good number of thunderstorms in our area so the audible alert can be a hassle. But the fact I can set it to only alert visually is great. We have a vacation home so I add the county number for that location when we are there. Most of those alerts are snow related and it really saved me once because we don't receive local stations there and a big snowstorm popped up out of the bright blue sky.I originally gave it five stars but knocked it down because of the user interface. I'm a techie and I can pick up an object I have not touched in a while and operate it. However, I always forget how to add a county number and it takes me a few minutes to figure it out. Maybe they have already improved it since mine is so old.
__label__2 Great radio! Nearly invisible instructions!: The OS WR 102 is a terrific radio, especially considering the price here on Amazon. It is essential to have a reliable weather radio since mid-Mississippi is subject to killer tornadoes and fearsome thunderstorms. I will certainly feel safer with this one close by.My only complaint: the instruction sheet is printed in a typeface so small I had to enlarge it on a copy machine in order to read it. While the instructions are clear, the layout is sensible, and the programming relatively simple, trying to decipher 4-point type made the whole experience needlessly frustrating. C'mon, guys! Your radio is a really good one! Why diminish a fine product with nearly invisible -- and thereby unreadable -- instructions!?
__label__1 Disapointed: I was never really able to get this unit working. After thinking I had installed weak batteries, I discovered that the only way to keep the unit powered was to apply pressure to the battery cover compartment. Additionally, I found installing batteries annoying due to a very thin peice of weather stripping that easily falls out of place and is not amenable to being replaced. I returned this item.
__label__1 Sealy Best Fit 330-Thread Count Cotton Sateen Sheet Set: Purchased this set of sheets on April 16, 2011, only two months ago. The fitted sheet have started piling, which indicates not a good quality set of sheets. The only thing that I loved about these sheets is the fitted sheet and how it hugs the mattress. For the price of these sheets the quality is just not there. The sheets that these replace were 5 years old and just started ripping, two months is unacceptable.Sincerely,Jody M Becnel
__label__1 OUCH!: First of all I must agree that these are the best fitting sheets you may ever find in your life. BUT, unless you love sleeping on the beach with nothing between you and clumpy, gritty sand, don't buy them. After several washings the fabric is truly so rough that it hurts. There is a fatal flaw- the fabric- and the manufacturer must change it if it wants repeat customers. Summary: fit is fantastic, sheets are terrible. Don't buy them.
__label__1 Like the idea behind the phone but not this one: this is my second cordless phone with a headset-this one I can not hear out of. I contacted the seller Rainbow Barter and they said all sales were final. So I tried to contact IBM sat on the phone 25 minutes the first time on hold, was disconnected and I am sitting again 25 minutes. maybe this time I will get luck :(
__label__1 Broken Bottle: Ordered this set for my grandma, it showed up 3 days before christmas and the main perfume bottle was cracked and had leaked every where.Wouldnt recommend buying from the seller, should have just went to jcpenny in the first place.
__label__1 Chiefs: I got a VHScopy that did not work on my video player.I was able to return to the sender.I would have liked to get the new DVD copy but found it too costly.It was a good tv series and book and Isaw it quite a long time ago.It's to bad that the cost is high.Ron
__label__1 Vague advice: I bought this book just before marrying a man with four children from his first marriage. I expected solid examples of stepmoms overcoming obstacles and sharing their wisdom. However, I found the book very frustrating: 1)the testimonials all came from women who were dissatisfied with their relationships, neglecting those who developed strong bonds with stepchildren; 2)the advice is all too vague to be applied. Chapters titled, "Simplify Expectations" and "Simplify Relationships" are filled with generalizations that are about as effective as telling an over-stressed mom to "just relax". Overall, a disappointing read.
__label__1 A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court: I thought that A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court By Mark Twain touched a lot of important aspects that our culture and society faces today while also satirized the times of Camelot. It also contrasted and showed the differences between the medieval times and the nineteenth century.But unfortunately I found this book hard to follow and had trouble getting into it. I felt that Twain often drug on certain topics or ideas. I think that I would have found this book to be a lot more interesting if Twain would have been more forward and to the point. I guess this book just wasn't for me, but others might find it interesting.But I do have a lot of respect for Twain for writing this. I'm sure that this book caused a lot of controversy since he wrote about a lot of sensitive topics, especially earlier in his time.
__label__2 A Great Satire in the form of a Great work of Literature: Mark Twain is no Science-Fiction author, but he makes this a good story anyway. He sends a mechanical genius back to the time of King Arthur to take a look back at America. Because of his knowledge, the narrarator becomes the King's right-hand man, the second most powerful man in England, known as The Boss. He begins to establish a more advanced society underground to gaurd against the Church. Over many years, he learns to adjust to the society and becomes respected world-wide due to his "magic." Unforetunately this results in making Merlin his great advisary. The Boss goes on many adventures and gets involved in many predicaments, each time surviving by his wit and knowledge. A wonderfully told tale that examines America's faults by looking at them from 7 centuries before. Unfortunately Twain, once again, falls short on his ending and leaves the reader mildly entertained, but not better off.
__label__1 I didn't really like the book it was boring, the end=best.: It was grat at some parts and boring at others. The end made up for alot of the book.
__label__1 very different book: i think that this book was very diffent. and that it was very hard to understand. most of the book i wasnt really sure what was going on just that he was magical and that he was in the past. there was definitly a twisted ending but thats ok. if i had a choice i probably wouldnt have read this book and read a different book on the list but oh well i got the pages i needed out of it.

__label__2 A Clear Differentiation of the Three Codes: Among the many works of Tibetan masters devoted to the three codes, none has enjoyed more notoriety than A Clear Differentiation of the Three Codes by the celebrated author Saskya Pandita Kunga Gyaltshen (or Sapan, 1182-1251), presented here in a Western translation for the first time. Not so much a text on the content of the codes themselves as an examination of the many particular questions that relate to the codes - questions that Sapan saw as subject to misunderstanding on the part of his Tibetan contemporaries - The Three Codes has a strongly polemical character. Thus it is easy to see why some readers found the work objectionable in places, others praised it, and all have become fascinated by it. Few indigenous Tibetan writings have inspired so abundant and diverse a body of later-commentary, commentary that rivals even that on the great Indian Buddhust treatises in its extent.
__label__1 What a disappointment.: My son's two favorite things in the world: 1. Little Einsteins, 2. Space. He went crazy when he saw the commercial for this new DVD. We, too, pre-ordered the movie and counted down the days until its release. And we, too, were bitterly disappointed by its contents. As the other reviewers have said, it is not a movie, and it is not about space. I would think that if Disney were going to release a space-themed DVD containing old episodes, they would at least include Galactic Goodnight. At least that one actually talked about the planets. I would not have purchased this if I would have been able to preview it before buying. :(
__label__1 Need something to light a fire? Here you go...: I gave this one star, because negative stars are not allowed. The previous review has to have been written by someone closely related to the book.I was a teen-ager during the '80s Ninja Craze and even then, this book would have been seen as a complete joke. I think I was expecting a Mutant Ninja Turtles cartoon to turn up somewhere in the book, but was disappointed to not see one.Bottom-line - Stay away from this book. If you are really interested in something about ninja, look into Stephen K. Hayes.
__label__2 A+: item came on time in excellent condition great service hope I can do business with this seller again highly recommended!
__label__2 As expected: I got this for my child and he loves it. Order flowed as expected, easy as pie. Comics are still a great gift.
__label__2 This guy was evil: This book shows you that Bob was a womanizer, but Bob was way worse than what this book says. Check out another book about Bob Hope called "Thanks For The Memories" by Brice Taylor. Yep, Bob and Michael Jackson had something in common, only Bob had underaged girls not boys.
__label__2 good for the tackle box: I got this as a gift for my 10 year old nephew who loves to go fishing. He needed some help getting the hooks out of the fish and this works great with his little hands. It fits nicely in his tackle box and the wood grain makes it look really nice. I am sure he will out grow it or end up dropping it in the lake but for the price i can afford to buy him another one later.
__label__1 thank you: This one gift I could give my grown daughter. I read this book over and over to her as a child. It was in wonderful condition!
__label__1 One Star, and it goes to JLH and the Stiller's: The characters with the smallest amount of screen time, played by Jennifer Love Hewitt, Ben Stiller and his real life dad, Jerry Stiller, are the only ones worth watching for in this sad little effort. The story is a mishmash and not at all interesting, but hey, Ms Hewitt does look great, so if you're into that I can recommend it. One thing I do want to point out, however, is that there is no commentary track on the DVD, contrary to what the specs show.
__label__1 Somebody shoot me.................please: Jennifer Love Hewitt is the only bright spot in this mind dulling dribble. The script leaves you not caring for the characters. I can't say the words to descibe this movie. There is maybe one or two semi funny scenes in the whole 90 min of boredom. If you like daydreaming buy this DVD, because you'll be so bored your mind will be wandering in thousands of directions.
__label__1 Worst book from Whitman ever: The black and white photo's look like photocopies of photocopies.And to add insult to everyone, the book is printed in CHINA...Whitman has sunk to a new low on this one.Buy any other book other than this one if you really want to use it.The poorest book that Whitman has ever offered, lets hope it's not theirstandard for the future.
__label__2 My nephew loved this!: I gave it all 5 stars just because my nephew loved it so much. He is very hard to please at 9 yrs old and this was something he really enjoyed. He likes hands on things and race cars so there you go.
__label__2 This is a Great Product!: I bought this having read some bad reviews about it but you get what you pay for! But I was actually blown away by it, the picture quality is wonderful, the sound is good unless it's noisy, though what I did was used some mini speakers you can buy for discmans they work great to add extra volume. The battery does last about three hours but it does come with an a/c adapter and car adapter which is nice. I also liked the fact that it came with a cord(don't know what it's called) but I was able to plug it into my home theater system for surround sound and also into my tv for larger picture. I also rent a lot of dvd's and all of the rentals worked fine for me, if your having trouble with a disc just clean it, I use soap and water although I hear that's a big no no but it's works great! Overall it is a awesome system for the money!
__label__1 it stings: picture is very bad sound not that good eather lacks lots of inportent features havey and bulkey almost like a notebook feels vary clumsey in your hand whorse of all whit slith tuceh dics door will open while playing
__label__1 Terrible Nickel Allergy triggered by strap connectors/adjusters: The strap loops and strap adjusters triggered a severe nickel allergy on my back where they touch the skin. There should be a warning on the tag but there isn't. If you have a Nickel allergy do not buy this. In most bras these connectors and adjusters are covered with or use plastic. This is bare metal and contains enough Nickel for an almost instant breakout.
__label__1 Product is cheaply made, Customer Service was terrible from Elmosworld: I purchased 2 of these items, on one of them, the LCD display does not work perfectly (the 0 as a part of 12:00 pm is missing a line of the 0 on the display- see my submitted pictures) but this is no big deal- the item still works OK.The other product arrived damaged since it has a battery compartment door that is made of cheap plastic at the bottom of the unit and UPS damaged it during shipping.It took me filing a complaint with Amazon just to get a response from this company, and the situation is still not resolved, they have not offered to send me a free return label to send it back to them.I will never order from Elmosworld again. Terrible customer service.
__label__1 Genuine Chinese Crap: This radio is insanely over-priced. You can get worse, but you can't pay more for it.The Oregon Scientific WR-8000 is a true piece of crap. Do not purchase it.I bought mine brand new in the box for two dollars at a church yard sale. Boy am I glad I didn't pay more for it.The Oregon Scientific WR-8000 is cheaply constructed all the way around. Everything about this shoddy radio is cheap cheap cheap. Want poor reception? You got it! Want brittle plastic that breaks easily? You got it! Want a compass that doesn't work? You got that too!Be prepared to do quite a bit of research to find an emergency radio worth owning. If it says "Made in China" avoid it if you can. If China does make anything worth owning they certainly don't export it to the USA."Oregon Scientific" is another term for cheap piece of Chinese crap.You will regret it if you buy this radio.Caveat emptor.
__label__2 I agree: I agree with the review from August 8, 2000 in that Mary Anne needs to move on and it wouldbe cool to have her do something else. However, I did really enjoy the book. I thought When Mary Anne helped Sunny it showed more of her personality from the old series, and I liked that Mary Anne more. I thought it was funny how active Sunny was.
__label__1 LOUSY PHONE: Good Price with a nice package, but very poor quality sound. We purchased 2 of these phones...both had echo, and low sound quality. We could not even have a conversation with the other party. Both are being returned!!
__label__2 Great CD: This CD contains nearly all of Peter Gabriel's through the album "So" in 1986. Go through the track list, and you will likely find more than a few you've heard on the radio. A glaring ommission is Gabriels' most famous (and possibly best) song "In Your Eyes". Although you will find that at least a quarter of the sixteen tracks on this CD come from "So", that song is missing from this collection. For that reason, I knock a point off this "best of" collection.
__label__2 Just what I wanted: I was looking for a good walking sandal that could be adjusted in case my feet were swollen (as often happens after flying). These were comfortable right away, the size was good, wore them every day and they were always comfortable, no blisters forming. Very happy with them, and would purchase other Propet products.
__label__1 poor quality: Item is very heavy and does not hold a charge well. illumination begns to dim almost immediately and is never very bright. I would not purchase this item again.
__label__1 Poor light - Looses charge fast: I have been purchasing a few of these self charging flashlights lately to find the best one.This one puts out a a poor amount of light. It also does not retain its charge well. You will have to shake it frequently to keep it charged.I would say it is one of the worst ones I purchased.
__label__1 Flashlight: Don't ever buy this. It is a rip off and a gimmick. Your hands will get tired really fast for shaking the flashlight and 30 seconds of shaking will not even get you 5 minutes of light with consistent brightness. Even more the light dims almost instantly after shaking with no retention of charge whatsoever. Other flashlights that require cranking can give up to 2 hours of light for 1 minute of cranking if you get the right one.
__label__1 Reed switch doesn't work, the flashlight is inoperable.: I am helping my son with an electromagnetic induction science fair project and have studied extensively the requirements for these types of flashlights to operate. This flashlight is better than the 'fake' shake flashlight we'd previously ordered for $2.35 at amazon.com, because it actually uses a real NIB magnet and appropriate circuitry. However, the reed switch (which uses a small magnet to connect the capacitor's stored potential to the LED)doesn't work. Thus, the LED won't light. I'm very disappointed with this purchase. There are genuienly amazing shake flashlights that, both in function and design are truly brilliant devices, but they cost a lot more than this flashlight, so it seems that the old saying, "you get what you pay for", is proven true, once again.
__label__1 Not Louie Anderson's finest hour...: I remember going to see this at the theater in 1988 when I was fourteen. Besides my dad and me, there were only two other people in the theater. They stood up and left halfway through. There was a good reason for this. This movie is very poor and I believe it only stayed in theaters for about a week before tanking. Good for nostalgia value only.
__label__1 Not Recommended: I am very disappointed with this phone. I have to press the talk button several times to get a dial tone, and then when I do get a dial tone and make a call, I have a very hard time hearing the person on the other end of the line. The caller id feature does not work, and I know it isn't my phone company because our other CID displays work fine. It always just flashes "Ringing" on the display when the phone rings. I have owned this phone for 6 months now, and I am planning to replace it very soon.
__label__2 Better than expected: I don't really expect a lot from Voyager novels. Fact is, I rarely buy them unless they're part of a series like this one. So, I found myself pleasantly surprised by this one. Carey doesn't rely as much on the bar to jar the reader in and out of the story and it's stronger for that. She gives Janeway her own unique voice and makes reading the book a pure pleasure. My only gripe is that Carey's love of sailing shows through far too many times and is getting a bit tedious since it's been the focus of her past several Trek yarns. But otherwise, an enjoyably pleasant book.
__label__1 Let's replace plot and acting with profuse profanity and see if they can tell the difference...: This movie is just plain bad.Don't get me wrong. I wanted to like it. Having come off watching American Zombie, which also sucked, I was hoping for some needed zombie respite. Not happening here.What dialogue and acting there is seems forced and badly delivered. Frankly most lines and acting seemed like they belonged in a bad porno rather than a good zombie movie (neither of which is this movie).It seems like whenever there was a lack of dialogue for a scene, it was simply replaced with profanity of all sorts.I ended up turning this movie off half way through it, which I very rarely do. I felt the movie bored me, offered nothing and basically wasted my time and money.If you want a "good" zombie movie, I don't think this is it. SeeDawn of the Dead,Zombieland,Fido,Shaun of the Dead,Resident Evil,Dead Snow. Pretty much anything other than this movie.
__label__1 Original thought: This movie had an original idea, but lact so much for being a zombie movie. At times it was just stupid! Another zombie movie id pass on. Doubt I'll be re-watching this movie any time soon!
__label__1 Low Quality Packing tape: I pack and ship items on a daily basis. I bought this tape to seal my packages. It was cheap (so yay for price), but extremely low quality. It will not adequately seal a cardboard mailer without many layers. Even then, I worry that the package will open in transit.Lesson learned. Next time I will pay more for a higher quality product.
__label__1 Bad!!I false advertiser!: I have to give them a negative-10! the add clearly says a 6pack so I ordered 5 sixpacs and the only sent me 5 rolls! Clearly false advertising! I even orderd some for my sister! What a rip off! Don't order from them!!!!!!!!!!!!Plus the shipping of $8 that is a RIP OFF!!!!!Scotch Sealing Tape, 1.88 x 54.6 Yards, Clear, 6 Pack (3690)
__label__1 sent wrong speaker: Speaker they sent was a cheap imatation. A real letdown from amazon. They should change the picture.
__label__2 there's nothing better than live rolling stones: i own three rolling stones albums now, but there's nothing like listening to them live on cd. there are two new studio tracks on the cd. at first, i thought they had covered "sex drive" by twisted sister and w.a.s.p., but a closer listen brung up different lyrics.
__label__2 Stones live with a full band: Many people prefer the Stones as just the 5 playing live, but I also like when they brought on this large troupe along for the shows, more backup singes, brass section and 2 keyboards. The Stones are much more controlled and played very well and together. What you dont get is the raw energy of a rock concert as you would find on their 1981 "Still Life" album, but I find this album most enjoyable. My only gripe is they left off "Gimme Shelter" which they did an incredible job at and threw in 2 lousy studio redcordings to get a hit single out of for bigger sales."High Wire" is a good song, the 2nd studio song "Sex Drive" is a joke and should have stayed in the vaults, complete waste to add that trash song to this magnificient live Stones album.You can get the accompanying DVD "Live at the Max" and se it for yourself.
__label__2 Awsome.: I dont know what the lower guys issues with his connection are, I have 0 issues with ping, mine is always in the 130 range. Maybe you should stop DLing porn while playing multiplayer games.This is a great game, very fast paced and enjoyable. You can choose to enter any type of vehicle, while being more arcade than simulation, the action and craziness are well worth the low price offered by EA games...
__label__2 G'Day! G'Day!: Great selection of songs, Mate. Disapointed that "Tie Me Kangaroo Down, Sport" was only instrumental. Other wise very happy.
__label__2 Great: Really good ! All the classic Aussie songs, including Waltzing Matilda,Botany Bay and Tie Me Kangroo Down...you don't want to miss this one.
__label__1 bling bling: man, this album is phat. the title track, "F the BS", and "Buttermilk Bisquick", have more sweet raps than all of p-diddy's albums put together. mix-a-lot has been dropping tricked-out heat rocks longer than anyone in the biz, and it shows on this record. he has elevated himself to the level of Abraham Lincoln, Ghandi, and Hitler with his pure genius. nothing on earth has ever touched me in such a way as this sweet album. ever since i picked up the 12" lp ... i have been a better person. rap on, mixy, rap on, and let those B.G.'s eat your dust, you loc-ed out O.G.holla
__label__2 Excellent service!!!: I received my shipment of this Blu-ray disc in excellent condition and in record delivery time. Thanks!
__label__2 Review by a music lover: If you love rock and roll music and you appreciate it's history, you will love this movie. Great sound, great music, great performances and solid acting. This movie confirms in my mind who the ultimate father of rock and roll really is and how the Rolling Stones came up with the name for their band. Very interesting.
__label__2 Changing from a 20th Century status and power driven environment to a 21st continuous learning and collaborative environment: After Image is much more than a marketing and branding education. Grant communicates very powerfully the change in structure and thinking that is necessary for individuals and for us as whole to succeed in the 21st Century. His explaination of moving from a work/status ethic to a continuous learning/collaborative/networking ethic provides a structure for individuals, organizations and countries to base their readiness for the real work of the 21st Century.
__label__2 Oh, yeah! The "Coriolanus effect"!: This one isn't really "science fiction," since, with only changes, it could be set in the here-and-now, or in Ruritania -- but it's pure Heinlein, and better written than many of his earlier works. At only 128 pages, it's also pretty short for a novel -- but it works. Lorenzo Smyth (a/k/a Larry Smith) is an actor convinced of his own talent (which, as it turns out, is actually considerable) who is hired to impersonate the Good Guy leader of a major political alliance, who has been kidnaped on Mars by the Evil Opposition. Against his better apolitical judgment, Lorenzo takes the job because it's a challenge, and almost immediately regrets it as the limited engagement spins itself out indefinitely. There's a minimum of strident overwriting of the sort Heinlein was often guilty of in pursuit of his moral and ethical positions, with the quietly-made exception of a plea for racial tolerance.
__label__1 Lousy 802.11 reception & transmission.: I'm using this on a Win98SE PC to connect to an Apple AirPort Base Station. It sees the base station fine, but when the Belkin is touching the base station it transmits at 70% signal strength. My PowerBook can see the base station at 100% one floor up, 80% on the second floor up.Belkin software was easy to use and configure. Maybe my HP Pavilion causes a lot of RF interference? Unknown, but I'd try a Linksys or Hawking over the Blekin. Don't be swayed by the price.
__label__1 Does not work with XP: After spending several weekends installing & re-installing this product on my XP Pro box, to use with its sister product (Belkin F5D6130 AP), I GAVE UP. Included CD was flakey -- so, got new driver from Belkin website. Installed & worked -- until I rebooted, then XP froze up. Had to disable an XP service (SSDP Discovery). After reboot, USB device is recognized, but offline, and cannot bring online. I have extensive experience with networking (20 years). Tech support was of no help. Could be an XP problem, but note: Belkin Driver is "unsigned". Avoid this product (for XP) until Belkin releases a better XP driver. Going forward, I will be looking for a wireless Ethernet bridge, possibly LinkSys WET11.
__label__1 How Could You Do This?!?: AAAGGGGHHHHHHH! That's the sound of millions of Anne of Green Gables fans screaming in collective disgust. Not only is this last Anne movie bad. It's HORRIFYINGLY bad! I am a strongly against capital punishment but this movie has given me pause. I can't believe the Canadian government didn't put the movies producer in front of a firing squad for the way he thoroughly trashed the wonderful stories of Anne, Gilbert and the gang (not to mention trashing the hopes of millions of Anne fans). How a movie producer could miss so badly after hitting two grand slams is totally beyond my comprehension. Why did he depart from the books and make up a totally different story? The first two Anne of Green Gables movies were beautifully done. This one gives censorship a good name.
__label__1 The worst movie ever: My family and I love Anne of Green Gables and cried through most of it.. we do not have a problem with the first 2... but............ we have been watching the series 1.30 each week and come to the last dvd the coninuing story and boy is is the worst acted and story movie we have ever seen... I do not know what happen to Anne ( megan fellows) she was dead in every which way you look at it, no sparkal, no love no joy or happeness in her eyes or face at any time, she acted like a 50 year old women, we know she grew up but a person who has sparkle and joy and laughter in their eyes never loses that, and her voice in a few years has become deep and old.. we are so disappointed and so upset with this dvd... how can ones acting and joy be gone so fast... help
__label__1 A Stain on Lucy Maude Montgomery: This final installment of an otherwise brilliant trilogy on the Anne of Green Gables story is beyond horrific. It is a stain on the memory of Lucy Maude Montgomery.
__label__1 unimaginably bad: I bought this despite the bad reviews because I thought it was impossible for an Anne movie to be that bad, but they managed to pull it off. Not only do they burn down Green Gables but they create chemistry between Anne and another man while things with Anne and Gil are cold. Come on people...all we want is a good chick flick with a nice ending!!
__label__1 Disappointing: I absolutely loved the first two Anne movies. When I heard they were finally making another movie, I was very excited to see it. I was extremely disappointed that the movie thoroughly strayed from L.M. Montgomery's enchanting story line. The story line was nothing like the true story of Anne, and although some may think it is a good movie in its own way, it is not worthy to carry the name Anne of Green Gables. The plot of this movie held no interest for me, and was extremely disappointing.
__label__1 Disappointing: This is the third installment in a series of dramatizations of Lucy Maud Montgomery's beloved Anne of Green Gables novels. Megan Follows and Jonathon Crombie return in their usual roles. Unfortunately, this third production does not meet the high standards set by the first, faithful installment. In a total of seven Anne novels, Montgomery provided fully enough amusing, sentimental, and unabashedly romantic material for three movies. It was a pity that the second production (Anne of Green Gables: The Sequel) departed somewhat from the novels; it's a crime that this third production leaves Montgomery behind entirely, transporting her characters forward in time, pitchforking them into a trite war plot, and resolving the incoherent plot elements with a tepid, candy-coated ending.
__label__1 dissapointed to say the least: I remember watching the Anne of Green Gables and Anne of Avonlea movies as a child from start to finish and then immediately rewinding them to start again. This movie is an intirely different story. Not only was it a far cry from the book version, I found it to be incredibly insulting. The anti-American sediment found throughout the movie is something that I took to heart and I belive that Kevin Sullivan did a wonderful job at alienating much of his audience by the thoughtless comments made in this film. I have about as much respect for him now, as he has for half of the people who have supported him by buying his movies. I will never buy another one of his films and unfortunatly, this is a movie that I will never share with my own children.
__label__1 Not the same as Anne 1 & 2.: This was a major disappointment. I loved the first and second of the Anne series, but this one does not have the same feel or charm that made Anne 1 and 2 so loved. Its like its not Kevin Sullivan making this. Its far to artsy and revolves around the war rather than the characters and green gables. They hardly even show green gables and it even gets burned down. (How could they do that!). I wish I'd never watched this, as its ruined the way I imagined Anne and the others to have lived, happily ever after is what I expected.
__label__1 Soooooo disappointed: I was so happy when I borrowed this movie from our local library. Now I'm only happy that I borrowed it instead of purchasing it. The books were , basically, thrown out when this movie was made. I was so disappointed. I will not watch this sequel again. If you really liked the first two movies, I would not bother to watch the 3rd. It left me feeling sick to my stomach at such a gross departure from the books and story line.
__label__1 Don't do it!!!!: The first two are wonderful but don't waste your time or money on the Continuing Story. It is awful, isn't even similar to the books and she does very un-Anne like things. Not worth it at all and very disappointing!
__label__1 Has NOTHING in common with the Books!!!!: There is nothing---and I mean truly NOTHING---in common between the "Anne books" and this movie! It's quite horrible in every way. I wish I could give it negative stars! Yes, the second mini-series of this trilogy takes frequent license, but it retains enough episodes and character of the book to be quite enjoyable in it's own way. THIS little "thing" simply keeps a few character names, retains several original actors, and truly and completely makes up a story out of whole cloth. If they were in such an itch to make a WWI "Anne," they could (and should) have made 'Rilla. But they made this atrocity instead. If you have ANY respect for the book, please just forget this movie exists. Hideous!
__label__1 Big Problems with Amazon's Quality Control: The DVD did not match the title of the cover. Literally the wrong movie was in the "Anne of Green Gables - The Continuing Story" sleeve. Pretty much of a let down. Come on Amazon get on your suppliers.Joe
__label__2 great movie great service: my daughter and I love this movie. we have been watching it since she was a child she is now in her 20's and we still watch it together.
__label__1 Darcy: On it's own, the movie is a very decent sort. However, it's quite disgusting the liberties Kevin Sullivan took with the storyline while pretending it was a continuation of the Anne of Green Gables story. I was very disappointed.
__label__1 I am very disappoinsted.: This film lost simple life of characters and sense of humor of basis of Anne's series.
__label__1 Not as Good: I didn't like the Continuing Story as much as Green Gables and Avonlea. I guess Anne and Gilbert was all grown up in the Continuing Story. Didn't really like the war atmosphere, felt so sad.
__label__2 still a riot, more hilarious: After reading Bitter with Baggage, I didn't think there could be a more spot on, hilarious take of a chick's life, that is until I picked up Going for the Bronze.Tanen captures a women's life and relationships, and the angst and humor that goes along with both brilliantly! This is the perfect book to share with a friend having a bad day--I've turned many a friend's tears of frustration into tears of laughter with a mere flip of the page. It's also the ideal book to share with each other to make a good day even better.If these crazy little chicks could talk, they'd make great guests on Oprah. Wait, if they could talk, they'd have their own show, and Oprah would be their guest.
__label__1 Not what I had expected: This course while extensive in activities, was not what I had expected. The course did not start out basic such as learning basic communication between two people. I think this course is better for someone who is some-what fluent in French already. In addition, this course is however good for refreshment or learning more where it comes to things such as ordering dinner or renting an apartment.
__label__1 DRIVE-IN SECOND FEATURE: "Are you really going out with him?""UH-HUH"."By the way, where did you meet him?""I MET HIM AT THE CANDY STORE AND THEN WE WENT OUT IN HIS CONVERTABLE AND PLAYED CHICKEN WITH A COP.""Cool. Did you win?""UH-HUH.""And the cop?""HE DIDN'T WIN.""Oh. By the way, what's his name?""OH, SILLY. DON'T YOU KNOW ALL HOT ROD JUVENILE DELINQUENTS FROM CHEAP LATE '50S EARLY 60S MOVIES ARE NAMED JOHNEY?""Johney Angel?""JOHNEY DEVIL. JOHNEY DON'T CARE ABOUT NOTHIN'. JOHNEY SAYS THE ONLY GOOD COP IS A DEAD COP.""Cool.""TONIGHT WE'RE ROBBING A CASE OF BEER AND HANGING OUT AT THE BEACH WHERE WE'LL GET DRUNK AND NECK AND SAY REAL OUT OF DATE THINGS TEENAGERS USED TO SAY.""That's real boss.""AND THEN WE'LL RUN A COP OFF THE ROAD AND SPEED AWAY IN A WILD CLIMACTIC CAR CHASE.""Cool. Can I come?"'SURE, IF YOU DON'T MIND GETTING KILLED IN A WILD CLIMACTIC CAR CHASE.""Uh, maybe I'll just stay home.""COOL.""Uh-huh."
__label__2 Very good!!!: Is it just me or does anybody else notice that the production standards on this disc aren't up to those of his other recordings? Play this album back to back with So and you will notice that the sound on So is much crisper and cleaner. Anyway, the musical content on this album is right up there with So and in some instances surpasses it. Oh sure, there are the obligatory "I'm only putting this tune on the disc in hopes that I'll get radio airplay" songs Steam and Kiss that Frog in which he tries to repeat the success of "Sledgehammer". Otherwise the songs on Us are some of the best that PG's ever done either lyrically or musically. Even the early nineties hit "Digging in the Dirt" is a pretty complex look into the psyche. If you like So, you'll be pleasantly surprised by Us. And BTW, if you like Us, check out Plus From Us which is a compilation of music from the musicians which appeared on, and inspired the music of, Us.
__label__1 Spend a little more and get a better router: I have owned and have friends that own different routers then this one and none are as bad. Two major problems with this router:1. Wireless range is BAD (I own a cheap router and it has twice the range)2. Router loves to disconnect from the internet when multiple PC's are accessing the internet at once.I have the latest firmware which states it addresses the disconnect problem but doesn't. Hopefully they will come out with a new version soon!
__label__1 Easy setup, poor range: I bought this unit after my Linksys wireless router died; I can therefore only compare it to the Linksys.Setup was EXTREMELY quick and easy. I got it up and running in just a few minutes. The UI of the admin app is very straight forward and I notice is strangely similar to the UI of SMC routers. I find it to be somewhat easier to work with than the Linksys UI.I am unfortunately not pleased with the transmission range of this router. I placed it in the exact same location that the Linksys had been in. A computer that was getting solid 100% connection strength with the Linksys is now only getting 50% with this unit. Another machine that was getting around 70% on the Linksys would not connect at all to this unit until it was moved to a different location.This would be an excellent unit were it not for the range problem... Perhaps there's a fix?
__label__1 DO NOT BUY THIS!!!: From the first day I bought this product it had problems.....I called my service provider and we established that my connection is fine.....its definitely the router!! I called Belkin tech support and they tried to sell me service support in order to fix my problem!!! I managed to fix the problem for a few weeks but it RETURNED!! The thing keeps losing connection and i have to unplug and replug the darn thing to get it going again!! Its a pain! i wish i had spent a few dollars more and got a decent router!!
__label__1 Repeatedly Hangs: This router has good functionality and ease of use, but reliability is more important for me and this router hangs about once a day, so I'm giving it 1 star. You need to unplug the power cord and plug it back in every time to get it to work again.The range is a bit disappointing, too. About 30ft indoors.On the plus side, 128bit WEP and ability to limit access by MAC address are nice, and it's very easy to set up.Reading around some forums makes me think that the hanging problem is not universal, so if you're lucky enough to get one that works, it's not a bad router if you don't need long range wireless.For me, I'm returning it for a refund.
__label__2 Good Solid Cordless Phone: I was very surprised to see ony two stars for this phone. I have had one for over two years and this phone has been a good solid performer. I am a self-proclaimed gadget freak and have tried many different cordless phone brands. I think that Panasonic and Sony make the best phone and I think that Panasonic, while the cheaper of the two generally makes better equipment. With two small kids ours has been dropped and moved multiple times and has never given us trouble. It has provided better clarity than my more expensive Sony phones as well. I will admit that the features that are jammed into this phone are a bit over the top but this is a very useful phone. In fact, I'm on the site to purchase one for my mom. Happy Holiday!
__label__1 ditto to horrible battery life...: my first panasonic 2563 works great...this 2583 won't hold a charge for more than 10 minutes talk time...and it's only two weeks old!!!!!!!!!!customer service offered to replace it with a refurbished model when all i'm looking for is a new battery...i paid top dollar so that i could trade it in two weeks later for a refurbished unit...........i'm very dissapointed with them...never another panasonic.
__label__1 Lousy support after the sale: We lost the handset. Called Panasonic to get a replacement, they would not sell us a replacement handset. Overall disappointed with Panasonic and this phone.
__label__1 Disappointed consumer: I had a Uniden phone for over 10 years which I loved. Unfortunately lighting hit and blew out all my phone lines and phones. I spent a lot of time trying to find the right phone and thought I had. I bought this phone about 1 1/2 years ago, not only does the battery go dead quickly but I have already had to replace the battery. Then my keypad started to wear out. I do not use the phone and/or keypad excessively. I was sure it was a defect so I called Panasonic. The options they gave me were completely unacceptable. I am now shopping for a new phone and it certainly will not be a Panasonic no matter what the reviews or features are.
__label__1 Panasonic 2563W: Not very happy with the clarity of this phone. Also, very uncomfortable the way it rests on my ear and it also feels like I am talking into an echo. Taking it back to Staples tomorrow. Overpriced. Unsure of what else to buy. Just glad to dispose of it.
__label__2 Amazing set of cookware!: Its been a very long time since I reviewed anything...but this set deserves my time to review. Though I bought this set elsewhere, I bought other pieces from amazon with the 4-for-3 offer to complete the set. I cook twice everyday and I have to say, Ive loved cooking with these pots! The 8 qt stockpot that comes with the set is what I use very sparingly, given its size...making it slightly unuseable for my small family of 4. Otherwise I got the 3.5 qt casserole, 2 qt & 3 qt. saucepans. I also got a 6 qt stockpot and pretty much those cover all my cooking needs. Very heavy and will certainly last a lifetime. I havent cooked with All-clad yet, so I cant comment if this set is comparable, but All-clad is definitely in my list :)
__label__2 Yes another live album, but this is diferent.....: There are interesting facts about the released of stripped:- Basically it is an "unpugged album" from the Stones.- It was the very first interactive cd.When I first bought this cd, it was the very first interactive multimedia record ever done (booklet came with instructions, intercative material, etc...also appears the very first Rolling stones site, by 1994 whe the internet was so new, the site shows only merchandise in just a few pages, all those years ago), it is very interesting looking and hearing "hidden tracks".Also, during the Voodoo Lounge tour, the Stones perform some "surprise gigs" in some cities.In the time of the Unplugged records, this is a testimony of great tracks recorded in a different way we used to hear the Stones.It is a great album, quite diferent, and of course "Like a Rolling Stones", a classic made a classic.
__label__2 Is Good: Yet another live Stones album, but it's good. Like most live albums from these guys, you get a combination of spendidly done covers (by the world's most underrated cover band) and Stones standards. My favorites are: the grinding rendition of Street Fighting Man, the fresh delivery of Shine A Light, and the must-have pairing of iconic band with iconic title on Like A Rolling Stone. If you are looking at this with any consideration at all, go ahead - you can't lose. This also comes with the reassurance that even though this band really hasn't given us much new worth listening to in about 25 years, at least they haven't lost their ability to put it out on stage (at least, as of the mid-90's when this was done).
__label__2 Unbelievable: I'll echo exactly what the previous 2 reviewers wrote, this film is amazing, unbelievable, almost beyond words. Here is a church, probably minutes away from our White House and our Congress (these who are supposed to be taking care of their neighborhood, which would be the whole, United States.) Anyway,The church is filled with people who support each other, and improve their neighborhood with knowledge, job training, peaceful demonstrations, free healthcare, and much more. The church seems to me, to be exactly what a church is meant to be.
__label__2 Our gritty female ancestors were amazing!: I started reading this little gem while researching material for an historical fiction novel and soon discovered that I couldn't get enough of their stories. Before reading this book, I was guilty of looking back at our history never imagining the grit and humor our ancestors possessed. A great read.
__label__2 Possibly Gabriel's best solo work: I was surprised to see some relatively-negative comments directed towards PG's second solo album. I recently re-visited this album after many years, and found that while some of the more popular albums (#3 and Security) have not aged particularly well, this one stands the test of time. I would rate this as PG's best solo album (or at least my favorite). Not as pretentious as the albums that followed it, but darkly moving.
__label__2 Fantastic SACD: This was never advertised as a multi-channel SACD and I am glad that they didn't try to reformat it. The definitive edition of Peter Gabriel's work is all on SACD now and are must-haves for any fan with an SACD player. What many people do not realize about SACD is that the sampling rate is 2.8 MILLION samples-per-second as opposed to a normal CD which is only 44.1 THOUSAND sps. It is as close to an analog stream that you can get.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. If you don't have a good ear for audio and a good stereo system to listen to high-definition audio on then obviously you will not hear the difference. But for Audiophiles? A dream come true.
__label__2 What a great 80's movie: I watch this movie over and over. I've watched since I was a little girl and I still love it to this day. It's a very addicting movie.
__label__1 girls just want to have fun: I am really dissappointed with Amazon. This product was meant to be delivered to me on the 19 March 2008. To date it has not been delivered, i have paid for it . I have tried to contact Amazon customer services to no avail. I will never purchase anything from the amazon website again.
__label__1 fake product: Dear all,I received this Ultraviolet Man Liquid Metal Summer by Paco Rabanne and I was very disappointed. It is a fake product. The bar code was replaced by another one. Someone cut out the original barcode. I used it and after 30 minutes I could not smell the perfume anymore. Terrible product I want my money back.
__label__2 A Keeper: Signature Killers was informative, educational, and kept me focussed and intrieged by the minds of criminals. By using different case studies, Robert Keppel brings into review some of the most disturbing crimes and analyzes the root and causes of these human diviances. A definate "keeper" in my books!
__label__1 Truth or Hype, Mr. Keppel?: I found that in at least one case mentioned in this book, information given to readers was not necessarily true. Was this book written after researching past newspaper articles or was it really from experience? I now realize how John Q. Public is lead by the nose into believing whatever hype will sell. Once again, the public is lead on a lynching, without the complete truth available. Look out for the boogyman - he still makes money for some people. I am disappointed in the book, knowing that if one case was based on public hype, how can I believe anything else in the book?
__label__1 Save your money unless you like pain: All I did was walk down a hallway twice in my house and both little toes feel as if they were cut up by razor blades. They look comfy but the front strap is stiff and just cuts right into your toes. Beware.
__label__1 There is no such thing as out smarting wall street!!: Is there really such a thing as out smarting wall street? They could have easily titled this book how to buy stocks that go up and short stocks that go down. Remember this book is from folks who don't know how to make profit in the business they run? Do you really want to learn how to invest from these people?
__label__2 Great Gun: Bought my nail gun about 2 yrs ago. Have driven many 2 1/2 in nails in oak, maple,cherry and pine and never had a misfire or jam once. Like this gun so much I bought one for my father-in-law for christmas. And yes I like him. Would recommend this finish nailer to anyone.
__label__1 It was a great finish nailer unitl it broke.: I bought the nailer over a year ago and use it every few weeks when I get some finish work. It is light weight and it is easy to clear jams. One day it would not fire. I took it to be rebuilt and had an estimate of $100. The guy called and told me it needs a new firing mechanism and it would cost $189. So I am ordering the Hitachi today.
__label__1 Didn't work with Windows XP: Ok, so Windows XP might be a bit advanced for such an inexpensive camera, but I wanted a very basic webcam I could talk to my significant other with for a few months while we're apart. This camera didn't come with drivers for Windows XP. I went to the website and downloaded what they said were the XP drivers, but still couldn't get it to work. I had my partner try to get it to work on my computer, he couldn't get it to work, and he's a computer guy! I finally sent it back and my brother-in-law and partner told me to go for the Logitech. I gave this one star because it didn't work for me...it might work perfectly well on all other OS's, but not on XP.
__label__1 Product does not work with windows XP: The product is most likly good. But It when I try to install it to my computer, the class install manager denied my request to install it. This was very frustrating beacaues I have to return it. The Micro Innovations customer service was terrible, the people would lie over the phone just to get rid of you. The man said he would e-mail me the drivers I needed to install it to my computer with windows XP. But never sent them. Non of this is Amazons fault but I wish that they show weather its compatible with windows XP.
__label__2 AWESOME: It's was an amazing start to one of the best journey's I've ever read. I feel honored to have been given it as a gift, an orignial copy, from my mother. I felt more honored to give her the other two books in the series as a gift, she had never known about. It's a series you curl up with on a winter's day that calls for a warm blanket and a serious lack of anything to do but travel back in time.
__label__2 A good look of life at the opening of the frontier: An interesting book from both a literary and historical standpoint. A view into the lives and struggles of the first settlers of the Dakotas. A good read, particularly for those with an interest in America's Scandinavian immigrants.
__label__2 Book club selection.: Our local book club decided to read and discuss this for December.I found the book slow-moving at times but well worth the effort!
__label__1 Cheap made product: After getting tired of looking for batteries for our other sharpeners, I decided to look for a sharpener closer to what I used in school. Well this one is not it. After three uses, the entire collection cup just came off and would not go back on after adjusting every way imaginable. In order to sharpen a pencil, the cup must be on securely and ours was just flat out broken. Also the pad on the bottom of the unit was very loose upon opening but we were still able to make it suction to our granite. Don't waste your money on this cheap plastic.
__label__1 Broke After a Few Months: I got this for my kids to use at home and for a few months it was a good little sharpener. Suction works well, not messy to dump out the shavings, etc. However, the teeth on the wheels grinded too much and stopped making the sharpening piece inside to turn.
__label__1 this player [stinks]: This player is great for DVDs, unfortunately I bought the player for its 5 disc cdr/mp3 playability. The player makes 2 second jumps on every song of every cdr I own. I took it in to get fixed. When I got it back, I plugged it in and still does the same thing.
__label__1 Very disappointed.: I had to return my bottle, because the 1st thing I noticed when I opened it was the odor, and the capsules literally looked like they had been put in an oven and toasted! They had a burned smell. I had been trying to take them for my digestive problems, but these were actually making me worse! Very defective bottle. I will not be ordering them again from Vitamin Shoppe if this is what you get. I have been taking Betaine Hydrochloride for several months, and this is the first time I've ever had a problem. I had been buying them from the local health food store, but was trying to save money getting them on Amazon.
__label__1 Terrible product: This is a terrible product. I have had the device not working error (10) and have tried every configuration. Buy something else and not Belkin networking.
__label__1 Luke-warm outline of a great American's life.: In "Founding Father" Richard Brookhiser attempts a moral biography of George Washington which focuses on his public life, all in order to bring him closer to us 200 years later. While a noble effort, Brookhiser does not follow through. Although mildly interesting, this book is too sketchy and reads as a mere outline of a more comprehensive work. There are better works out there that bring Washington closer to our hearts than this one.
__label__2 A Brilliant Catalog of Psychological Disorders: What do an amnesiac, an assassin, a chronic compulsive, and an institutionalized lunatic have in common? They all enjoy residence on this incredible album by Peter Gabriel.The amazing lyrical territory is matched by unprecedented sonics, which married dry guitars, erratic keyboards, with heavily gated drums (which would later become Phil Collins trademark sound).One of the greatest albums of the decade.
__label__1 Another Cheryl cullen disappointment: This is one of the worst brochure design books I have ever seen. Outdated design and most of them from the United States.More like a marketing tool for Cheryl Dangel Cullen's designer friends.most of the designs dont even show the brochure covers.Another huge disappointment from Cheryl Dangel Cullen(same with Global graphics:colour and Global graphics: symbols, both of which are showcases of wrong information.)I wouldnt even give one star, but that is the bottom of the barrel!
__label__2 Heed my advice!!!: I had a lot of trouble getting this to work with Windows XP, but to all those people out there who are having the same trouble, THIS CARD WILL WORK, it is just a real pain getting it to do so. After spending hours trying myself and using tech support, I figured out the problem on my own. First of all, you must download the XP drivers from the Belkin website. THEN, you need to use the utility that comes on the CD rom, *NOT* the generic one for Windows XP. Besides the setup trouble, the card works fine, the price is right and I have no complaints [now].
__label__1 Broken Drivers for Windows XP: I've had a horrible time with this F5D6020 PCMCIA card. I'm quite adept with wireless networks - have two laptops and several desktops with wireless cards in them. Some of the biggest problems I've had have been with this Belkin card, Windows Zero Configuration for wireless networks, and WEP secured networks. I connect to wireless networks, secured and unsecured, just fine, but the drivers are mangling ARP, and so I can't run TCPIP over the connection.Despite the fact that the card is advertised to work with XP, it doesn't include signed drivers - and the drivers it does have are what's wrong with it.
__label__2 Earth Crisis said "All Out War!": And here it is haha!As soon as I heard there was a movie about straight-edge kids coming out I freaked. First I thought it was goin to be like a Hollywood straight-edge thing where they'd confuse edge with emo or something and I didn't want to see some edgers whining about girls. But then I heard it was made in the NYHC so I was super excited when I saw it at Tower. The first half was ok it was kind of boring and there were black & white parts that I still don't know why they were black & white, but once the riot begins it goes off like nothing you've ever seen before. Props to the filmmakers for some violence that's as real looking as Boston Beatdown, which actually is real! I just wish they could have played Project X "Straight-edge Revenge!" during the riot haha O.L.D.!!!
__label__1 Keys Unresponsive, would not respond to keystrokes...: Received this keyboard today and was very dissapointed. I can't believe IBM actually allowed Micro Innovations to put their logo on this item. When typing, the keystrokes either were not recognized or would display seconds later. Receiver "data" light blinks showing that are you pressing keys, however, the keystrokes are not sent to the computer.Returning item now as I type on a good/working LOGITECH wireless RF keyboard.
__label__2 Has lasted years and passed on from older brother to little brother.: This item was bigger than expected which was a very nice surprise. It has lasted for several years used by one boy then passed on to his younger brother when he was interested in looking a bugs. It is easy to store on a shelf and find when suddenly a bug springs up that a boy wants to take a closer look at. the mesh cover is somewhat transparent but the best view is from the clear acrylic door not the side. No bug has ever accidentally escaped yet.
__label__2 Elvira Madigan: This DVD of a 1967 Swedish movie was just as I have remembered it when it was first released. Great photography and great background music. A most enjoyable film that can safely be viewed by all the family.
__label__2 goo product: good product and works good on my hunting vehicle never comes off even in wooded areas when hit by limbs
__label__2 Good quality: It's a good product for 11m band CB Radio, not too long and long enough for a SWR acceptable.there is also a rubber cover on the pedestal who can prevent from the paint damage
__label__2 Magnet mount antennas: Simple. Effective. Easy. Portable. Switchable between vehicles. Inexpensive for what you get. It doesn't get any better does it?? :-) I could make this long and add a bunch of tech notes ie ease of adjusting SWR; effective range etc etc, but I think it is unnecessary. If you need more than a good CB, time to move up to the HAM world.
__label__2 Still Great: Still Life captures the sounds from the band's Tattoo You tour, which was their first extensive tour of the US in several years. The band sounds tight and revitalized. It is interesting to hear them play "Start Me Up" as it is was a new song at the time and they hadn't yet played it a million times. "Shattered" and "Just My Imagination" are roaring and their version of The Miracles "Going To A Go-Go" is a crowd pleaser. "Under My Thumb" is another very strong cut and it has a unusual, but perfectly fitting, intro with Duke Ellington's "Take The 'A' Train". Still Life shows the band at the peak of their concert playing, where the songs still sound fresh and haven't become old warhorses.
__label__2 Time really is on their side.: I remember I used to hate "The Stones" for years. The local stations would just run them into the ground and completely ruin them for me. Now, as an adult, I can't get enough of them!I just recently got this CD and thought it was a great live show. Maybe not one of their best but great all the same. Good mix. Good selection of songs. Very energetic. I would recommend this to any Stones fan, young and old.
__label__1 Spare yourself the agony and rent Chinatown instead: This sequel to Chinatown must be one of the most disappointing films I have ever seen. It is badly written, badly directed (by star Jack Nicholson), and contains bland performances by two of my favorite actors, Nicholson and Harvey Keitel.Spare yourself the agony of wasting 99 cents on renting this turkey and rent the masterpiece Chinatown instead.
__label__1 Shapeless sack: This is a shapeless sack with pockets. Absolutely no thought has gone into design. When you are carrying 40 lbs on you, distribution of weight becomes critical, else you are likely to end up with a major case of backache. Having used the vest a few times and each time spending the following day in bed, I can vouch that the manufacturer has spent no effort in designing the product. I have an Altius (20 lbs). What a wonderful vest!
__label__2 Great Movie: I was lucky to see this movie on TCM not long ago, and enjoyed every moment of it. I would absolutely love to own it on DVD......sooner rather than later. Fabulous move, and Cary Grant is great in it!!
__label__1 Too small: The color is great and so is the feel. I love jersey knit. I have a pillow-top matress and the fit was pretty snug right off. I wish I would have returned them right away, because I knew that once I washed them they would shrink. I did tumble dry on low, but they shrunk considerably, and even with stretching they are just too small for my mattress. These are not meant for a pillow-top. So I gave them away to someone who has a full and they fit perfectly.
__label__1 ESSAYS OF FRANCIS BACON (LARGE PRINT): DID NOT MEET DESCRIPTION BY AMAZON.THERE WAS NO LISTING BY EACH ESSAY TITLE.THERE WAS NO DESCRIPTION IN EACH ESSAY OF MEANING OF ELIZABETHAN TERMS,NOR ANY TRANSLATION OF FREQUENT LATIN QUOTATIONS.NOR ANY INTERPRETIVE COMMENTS ON THE ESSAYS.ALL THESE THINGS ARE FOUND NORMALLY IN MODERN EDITIONS.THIS BOOK WAS DOWNLOADED FROM THE INTERNET AND IT SHOWS.
__label__2 Computer gamer: This is a good quality game and it's played a lot in our household. We play one-person "Mahjong" very often here (maybe too often?) and everyone from the adults to the 8 year old is hooked on this particular game. There's a two person version as well, but it's not as big of hit in our household. The graphics on the tiles are detailed, so this may not be a game for laptop size screens, but works just fine on regular larger monitors. You've also got the option to choose different tile graphics and layouts, which might help. One reason we purchased it is so that it could be played both on the Mac and the MS PC and it does that well. It has some fun sounds as the tiles are matched and removed. If you have the CD in, you get the sounds. Without the CD, no cute sounds, but the game goes faster, so it depends on what you want. I like the quality, the flexibility, and the challenge of the Mahjong game offered in this CD.
__label__1 A Negative Tren: We had the old DOS version of Hoyle Solitaire (1988 Copyright) and when I bought a new computer we wanted to update to a current version. Installed new version and found the following: 1.) Autoplay disappeared. Lets one play out finished game without manually clicking each card. 2.) Replay game is missing. Sometimes it took several tries to win a game, but this is gone now; you can't try again. I re-installed the old version from 1988 (One 1.4MB diskette) and find it better than the current version. Any owner of the old DOS version who buys this version will be severely disappointed; you spent money to downgrade to an inferior product.
__label__1 Henryk Sienkiewicz Trilogy box: After a month waiting not received yet !!!Ordered 22nd February 2011Copenhagen, 26th March 2011
__label__1 Read the books...skip the movie.: I love Louis L'Amour, especially his epic series: The Sacketts. The stories are believable, tautly written and accessible for just about anyone. Unfortunately, the same cannot not be said about this movie, which is based upon two of the stories: The Daybreakers and Sackett. With great anticipation I watched this movie. I wanted to enjoy it, but no matter how hard I tried I coundn't for one simple reason: The acting is atrocious! Tom Selleck is awful. Mercedes McCambridge is awful (really awful), and sadly, worst of all is Glenn Ford. The best acting comes from the veterans Ben Johnson and Sam Elliot, barely. What frustrates me is that these are talented actors! What kind of direction were they receiving from Robert Totten?? "One take and next scene" must have been his credo. Really disappointing.Don't waste your money. Read the books instead.
__label__1 How to Handcolor like a Hallmark Artist.: This book is great if you want to stick to only one medium, Marshall Photo Oils. The examples are sappy and saccharine.Cutesy kids, flowers, bla bla bla! This book copies the style and explanations of Handcoloring Photographs Step by Step by Laird. Thats because Dorskind has nothing to say herself and doesn't know how to explain. Now you should buy the book by Laird. I, like most reviewers recommend it strongly. I also highly recommend to you Handtinting Photographs. Buy this book too. Don't buy Dorskind's book. Its a waste of money.
__label__2 You Must Listene to This CD: Wonderful poetry, interesting, slightly sad, personal, diverse, including some fragments (choral) in RussianInstrumental arrangments innovative, fusing pop sounds with Eastern colors and instruments (Ud?, Balalaika, Dombra?)The voice on the CD is intimate, powerful, very personal, sounds distinguish this CD from many pop recordings; some jazz elementsFavorite songs: Kabala, Sleep My Son, Queen of Night
__label__1 Worst Dragonlance Book I Ever Read: I read my first Dragonlance more than 10 years ago and I've been an ardent fan since. So when I got my hands on this one, I was full of expectations.However, this book was a real letdown. I had to force myself to go through each page and finally gave up. The narration sounded like sentences in childrens' books. The kender didn't seem to act or speak like kender and the gully drarves were either too smart or too irritating. The death knight wasn't much of a Death Knight nor was Takhisis her usual Godlike self.The author, being new to Dragonlance series should have done her homework better and found out more about the Dragonlance world we all know and love. This was really a waste of such a promising title as a book of short stories on Uncle Trapspringer's adventures would indeed be very welcome to the Dragonlance series.
__label__2 It's Kim Carnes!!: How could you not love it? The double set saves half the storage space. A "must" for any Kim Carnes fan.
__label__2 Open the Door: This is the beginning of an incredible series--and Ms. Duane says the fourth and final book is FINALLY coming out this year! I love Ms. Duane in all her shadings, but I believe this quartet is among her finest work. Every page is edged with light. Her characters are so real that I wish they lived down my block--so I could go talk to them and learn more about them. I can't wait for the fourth book. At last, at last!
__label__2 My Fave Album Of All Time: My favorite song "Science of Silence". Trying to explain it could never do it justice. Just beauty personified. Music is amazingly beautiful. Thanks Sir Richard.
__label__1 Portable red flashlight: Terrible product. Switch malfunctioned after just a few months and I could not find a replacement. Avoid purchasing this model if you expect long term use and reliability. I have had a number of flashlights in the past and this one really lowered my expectations.
__label__2 Waechtersbach KIWI plates.: Waechetersbach (pronounced Veck ters bahk) dinner plates have got to be the most vibrant,colorful along with festive and great quality plates I have ever purchased. I bought the "Coupe" style in Kiwi. The "Rimmed" style seemed to be a brighter lime green color. The coupe style had a bit darker of a hue but I still think they are fabulos. Amazon had the plates at my door in a week. For more colors try Waechtersbach warehouse, or Waechtersbach usa.They are a bit on the expensive side... about 12$ per plate, but so well worth it. :)Also: NOT microwavable (it will crack the colors on the ceramic) but dishwasher safe.
__label__2 The Endearing Honesty of A Woman's Life: My husband happened upon a copy of the original book in a thrift store and brought it home. It has now found a place of honor on my shelves. It takes you on Diana's journey through her self-discovery as a lesbian, through her brother's rejection of it, to the pain of heartbreak, to the lover that was a recurring interference, and to finally resting comfortably and contendly in the arms of the love that would be to stay. The book takes you through her childhood, her travels, and her education. She presents the story of a lesbian who is not out to emmasculate men, nor to promote women as the supreme goddess. She simply walked the road of her soul.
__label__2 I cant believe more people dont know this band: Since by man play some of the most passionate, energetic, and moving hardcore ive heard in a while... this album makes you want to dance in the street and flail your arms around like an idiot, and kiss some random girl getting out of her car and run like hell... what do they sound like? somewhere between converge and the swing kids with a little bit of refused... there are alot of really strong riffs and melodies on here, even though they are not always technical riffs. these guys just plain bring the rock, and you need to hear this if you like hardcore or punk... turn it up as loud as you can.
__label__2 Fun History: I couldn't put this book down. If you are a history buff like me this is like brain candy. Nothing too in depth but a fun read.
__label__1 Check out before you buy: The product looks ok. The buttons are nice and big and easy to read. They don't work very well though. For example when pushing on the speaker button to dial or answer the phone often I have to press it several times and just right for it to work. It does not come with the AC adapter and Northwestern Bell no longer makes or distributes them. Without the adapter the lights do not work, including the message waiting light. It is not what it was reported to be and does not function the way it is supposed to because it does not have an adapter. I have tried several stores such as Radio Shack, Best Buy, Walmart and Target to find an adapter (120VAC to 6V 100mA) and cannot find one. I have not been able to find one online either. Also the product information indicates this phone takes 3 AA batteries. It does not. This one takes 4 AAA batteries. Not that the size of the batteries makes any difference to me, but the description is not accurate for the item. I am sending it back.
__label__1 NO!NO!NO!: DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK. ... He makes incredible errors of historical fact-well known historical fact, at that. For heaven's sakes never mind his errors regarding the women's lives, he puts Warm Springs (where FDR died) in West Virgina instead of Georgia(and where were his editors?) His lack of understanding of the truth of women's lives is no worse than many otherwise credible male biographers. Read it with a spoonful of salt, and you will learn of many women who have been overlooked. Just know going in that you are reading what amounts to a shallow overview magazine type article. Not unenjoyable just disappointing. I ignored the whole rating thing which is absurd.
__label__1 Get with the times: For those who don't want to be dragged into the new .net world. There is still asp...however, 2.0 is the old version, at least get 3.0
__label__1 Worthless: As a beginner I found this book worthless. Many of the scripts in the book and on the CD apparently do not work. I asked a friend, who is a bright engineering student with programming experience, to try to try her hand at getting the guest book script to work and she didn't have any luck either. I submitted a question twice to the online Q&A forum over 3 weeks ago and it has yet to be posted, nor have I received any acknowledgement that the message was received. In my opinion this book fails on all counts. I advise beginners to look elsewhere.
__label__2 The Best Wisdom Poetry Of Our Age: "The dead can tell us, being dead, what no living personcan tell us," wrote T.S. Eliot. What Masters has done for us(when he was alive) is write a collection of whispered epitaphs,voices silently crying out from the graves the ironies, sadnesses, wastes, agonies, and miscalculations of their spent lives.This is not poetry to turn a phrase, necessarily. Nor is it poetry to enchant. Instead, it is Wisdom Poetry. Poetry that carries the weight of mistakes of the twisted lives, creating their own kind of hell (Hobbes: "Hell is truth too late learned").Written in 1915 and written as if for choral voices--wouldn't this be a great piece for a dramatic interpretation in which several voices perform each poem? Collected, it becomes overwhelming, just as a visit to a cemetary to mourn the losses of one of your loves can also be overwhelming.No, it is not sad, though. Somehow, hope still survives, like the shoot stabbing through the cracked granite toward the sun.
__label__2 Could've used more guitar, but still good: The latest offering from Unit: 187 is a little more geared towards total electronics than eletronics mixed with heavy guitars. But that doesn't make this a bad album. Most of the songs come off as instrumentals with Tod Law shouting one or two lines here and there. The electronics still have the trademark Unit: 187 sound...very abrasive and harsh. I would've maybe liked to have seen more lyrics or guitars in these songs, but they're still good. My favorite is by far the title track, which opens the record. Both mixes of Anger Management are also good. If you have the other releases from the boys, pick this one up as well. It's worth it in my opinion.
__label__2 LOVE this cookbook! Great old-fashioned recipes: Great cook book. A lot of great, tried and true recipes, like the standard Chocolate Chip Cookie and Peanut Butter Cookie. Love how they spell it 'Cooky' though. A few of the recipes are a bit outdated, like Prune cookies, but most of them have stood the test of time. Great fun to flip through, easy to read font, old-fashion little illustrations here and there and a lot of full colored pictures of the cookies. I have to say, some of the cookies aren't pretty, but they taste great. A true original and practical for children to use do to the ease of the ingredients and font style. Oh, and almost all of the recipes call for shortening, so substituting butter is a must. Great for collectors. Bought this to replace my Mom's original copy from the '60's.
__label__2 Remember from my childhood: I love this book. Not just because I used to love making cookies with my mom years ago, but the variety of cookies make this book one of the best. Highly recommended.
__label__2 Christmas all year: This is a treasure trove of wonderful cookie recipes. Pecan crispies are light and elegant. Thumbprint, Russian teacake, meringues and sugar cookies are holiday favorites. Shamrock cookies become witches' fingers for Halloween with just omission of food coloring and a different rolling technique. Almond butter, French lace, nut crunch cookies. Of course, there are hundreds more--your favorites, no doubt! I recommend buying this book if you bake, or if you hope to. But I will add, it's not the "original" Betty Crocker cookie book. My mother has that--from the 30's or 40's I think, smaller and with fewer recipes, but awesome. This version has vivid color photographs so you can drool--or occupy your kids with just visuals--while you consider what to make next!
__label__2 Betty Crocker Cooky Book: Fast shipment, easy to find what I wanted. It was a gift for my daughter. Just what I ordered.....used but in very good condition. My daughter was very happy!
__label__2 A FAMILY TREASURE: My girlfriend used this Cooky Book when her two daughters were growing up. They both treasure it, even though it is falling apart from so much use! When I discovered that it had been reprinted, I just had to purchase one for each of my friend's daughters. They were thrilled to each have their own copy. What a family treasure!!
__label__2 Good stuff: When I listened to it, it made me miss Dream Street even more. I wish they had still stayed together and then the CD would have been all Dream Street songs! But regardless, it's a good CD! The new stuff is really good, but it was kind of weird putting "You're Taking Me Over" next to "With All My Heart" because their voices were still high in YTMO, but had dropped by WAMH. I also enjoyed hearing some of the redone old songs! If you like Dream Street, go out and buy this CD! Why are you still reading this? I said go out and buy it!
__label__2 DS RULEZ!: Ok this is Dream Street...what more can i say? they are great and have amazing voices! This cd is awesome and the movie is too! The songs are catchy and u can tell there is a major voice change compared to their first cd. Also the song, With All My Heart, gets to me every time i listen to it its such a great song...one of their BEST! ok so anyways all i'm saying even though its been forever since the CD came out and since the Dream Street brake up that doesnt mean that you still can't support them...so hurry up and get the CD cuz there really isnt that many copies left, well the last time i checked there wasn't...ok thats all i gotta say.
__label__1 They sounded better in their debut: As you grow up, your voices mature. They are suppose to get better. This did not work for Dream Street, unfortunately. Their debut is so much better, even though Jesse was what, 14 and sounding as Aaron Carter did when he was 11. I think it's highly unnecessary for a soundtrack, just because they are in the movie, to have 65% of the songs theirs. The only songs I really liked on this is "I Say Yeah" (which is, again, WAY better w/ the original version) and "I'm Gonna Make You Love Me", even though I dislike Play, I thought the song was pretty cute and Chris added a nice 'flair' to it.
__label__2 DOLPH LUNDGREN ROCKS!!!!!!!!!: i love this film.dolph in his best film role.this is the movie that made me a fan of his.lee is awsome too.the best ninja type film i've ever saw.
__label__1 Only got the NT for luke: Not the book it should be. I am very disappointed since i got the wrong item. Please do not sell books to people if you are not giving what is shown. On a positive note, I understand we all make mistakes! Please dont do this again however to anyone besides myself. Honesty really is the best policy! God bless you!!!
__label__2 The funniest movie about the 60s ever: . . . and it comes from France! Set around a funeral, a family gathered - perhaps for the very last time - in grief, and in the midst of a near-revolution, The May Fools manages to cover the entire history of the 60s through hope, euphoria, and paranoia, back to a cynical, sad reality. Still one of the funniest movies ever made.I am fortunate to have an old video tape of it. I am writing this in the hope that someday it will be released on DVD for American audiences.
__label__2 Excelente, como todos los libros de él.: Es una lectura muy amena, para el que sabe un poco del idioma astrológico, sin embargo es fácil de leer, y el libro a diferencia de otros de SA está escrito de una forma más informal debido a que es tipo conferencias de pregunta y respuesta.Es un excelente complemento para el otro libro del mismo autor Person to Person Astrology.
__label__1 I'm sure it's useful if you could read the print!!: This Concordance has the SMALLEST print I've ever seen in ANY book!! Even with my reading glasses I have to squint in order to make out the print. I even tried a magnifying glass but gave up. I don't know who would able to use this book. I wasted my money since I can't even read it!!
__label__1 Not complete does not offer the original word next to the Translation: I am very disappointed to see what this book ended up being. I was expecting a Compact version of my Strong's Concordance but they changed it to the point of worthlessness. It is worth lugging the big book around in order to see the truth.For example you will never know from this book that YHWH (Hebrew 3068) is used nearly 7,000 times in the Hebrew scriptures.
__label__2 Struggles with Faith: There's no getting around it: regardless of his actual faith, Joseph Arthur is a Christian folk rocker. Nothing wrong with that, just a fact that grounds the sixteen stellar tracks of his third release Redemption's Son. Though his belief runs deep, the thrill in his work is that his faith doesn't come without continuous struggle. Like his idol (and label-owner) Peter Gabriel, Arthur turns experience of the day-to-day into the epic. Unlike Gabriel, his music is still in touch with the simple verities. He keeps his progressive tendencies in check, relying on solid narrative details and the ragged beauty of his countertenor. The title cut, "Dear Lord", "Evidence" - each root their moral struggle in a recognizable situation: absentee father, social estrangement, addiction. The drawback is that every song reaches the same conclusion - there's nothing that God can't put right. Still, it's a testament to Arthur's gifts that the end doesn't nullify the journey.
__label__2 The Complete Idiot's Guide to Online Genealogy, Second Edition: Very informative for the novice Genealogist. Helpful hints of where to look for information both online and in the library.
__label__2 Miseducation is an impressive show of Lauryn's talents: My favorite songs on this album are "Too good to be true" and "Ex-Factor". Lauryn's singing/rapping talents are amazing! (Not to mention her acting talents,too) I was impressed by her strong voice and incredible rhythm. This album definitly deserves the grammys it was nominated for. I can't wait for Lauryn's next album and would absolutly love to see her perform live!!!
__label__1 last reviewers info: would like to know where you got that info on lauryn hill saying she'd rather her kid starve than let her cd get in hands of a white person... i am a 'white' woman and am considering buying this... cuz i like her values and morals that i heard her sing of when a friend played 'to zion' for me. i am a christian and i rarely listen to secular stuff, but consider buying this...but not if she hates 'white people'. would like to know the source of your info, lem.
__label__2 A blend of beauty and magic!: This CD is magical, the lyrics are deep. I've been a Lauryn Hill fan from the way back days of the Fugees and she's simply AWESOME. It's no surprise she nabbed 5 Grammys from this album, her first solo. This represents what good music should be, just buy it and listen to it's magic!!! To say the truth, this album deserves 10 stars!!! Lauryn, I thank God for your life and inspiration, keep up the good work!!!
__label__2 Classic Lauren: Lyrics are very relavent to these days and times that we live in. Music is awesome, vocals are still hot!
__label__2 Lauren you're the best and keep getting better: Lauren I love you and your music I generally don't liste to younger artists because of the violence they promote, but you're style is so different and you give all honor to God first and foremost. The CD is just "Awesome" keep up the good work.
__label__1 Simultaneously pretentious and moronic: This is even more brain-dead than the average rap CD. She's certainly pretty enough; why can't she hire someone to write her some decent songs to sing? Or one even.
__label__2 Lauryn Hill is an exceptional music artist.: For anyone who is knowledgeable about music artists, you can only say one thing about Lauryn Hill. She is totally blessed with an extreme talent. Her music is so profound because so many can relate to her realness. It is clearly evident that when a host of people are moved with your music, you have touched a place universal in the hearts of those who have listened. When I first heard Lauryn in "Sister Act" and found out that she was a rapper in the group "Fugees", I said WHY? No disrespect towards rappers, I simply was floured when I heard her sing, I knew right then that I would be hearing more from her in the near future and it was manifested in her debut album. I am an artist myself and I would love to get the opportunity to work with her one day. "She is what you call a music perfectionist". And how beautiful to know where all the credit comes from, GOD. She is one who truly knows why she is so successful.
__label__1 A decent album, I've heard a lot better though...: Although I'll admit this CD has its charms, I firmly believe that it should not garner a five star rating. The detriments to this album include the following: first, the album is full of Lauryn Hill speaking inane lyrics that faintly resemble some sort of electronica instrument; second, the songs lack differentiation (as in they are mostly the same beat.); and finally, the bitter lyrics really give me a headache. (Disregard the rambling run-on sentances.)
__label__2 This Lauryn Hill at her best.: This is one of the most sincere, heartfelt cd's I've listened to. The tunes are great. My favorite song is #16. P.S. Her hidden tracks make for a nice surprise.
__label__2 Individuality coupled with Tradition: Words can only do a disservice to the scope and deep emotion that this album not only invokes, but also infuses in its listeners.Listening to this one remembers the strength and power personified in the great Sojourner Truth's epochal poem, "Ain't I A Woman."Listen to it yourself and you will see...you sure are a woman Lauryn Hill.
__label__1 I would give it no stars if it was available!!: This album, is so full of phony music, "Lauren, honey you dissappointed me, I guess I'll stick to the Fugees, rather than on your solo" This album has no real freshness, it all sounds the same, all the songs are of about the same beat, there is nothing that lift my soul to even want to sing along with her lyrics, the only one is that last song, in the album, which is an oldie just revised to a new version. I really thought she could have done a lot better especially with winning all those grammy's.
__label__1 i would have givin it less!!!!!!: i would give this less cuz shes a terrible person and artist...the only reason i bought this cd is because she said she would rather have her kids starve then a white person get her cd...well....im waiting!!!!!
__label__1 not even 1 star: utter garbage - give me $1.00 for every flat note lauren hill hits on this album and I would be a millionaire
__label__1 I laughed hard when I heard about her Medusa snake-hairstyle: Bah! not worth much. hip-hop you say? Maybe Bull-hop is more applicable here. get a clue about real rap artists miss Medusa!
__label__1 What is the big fuss about!!: It's funny, I can never figure out the music business and MTV any more. This is the most overrated, overhyped album I have ever heard, and yet they talk about it like it's gods gift to music fans. I admit there are a couple of tracks on this album that I like, but the rest forget about it. Being a somewhat introspective person myself, I understand that this album is a personal expression of sort, but where is the melody on most of these tracks? I love soulful, heartfelt music as much as the next guy, and I think maybe some other artists out there can learn that from Lauryn; however there isn't much else in this album. I think Brandy is much better than Lauryn, but doesn't get nearly the credit she deserves.
__label__1 I HATE RAPP: THIS JUST GOES TO SHOW THAT THERE AREN'T ENOUGH GOOD ARTIST AROUND, THAT THEY WOULD NAME A RAPP ARTIST AS BEST OF ANYTHING.
__label__2 Great CD: After buying this CD for its hype, I became an instant Lauryn Hill fan. All songs on the CD were fantastic. Some better than others, but all good. My favorites are "to Zion", "Ex-Factor", & "Forgive them Father". If you like hip hop you will love this CD!
__label__2 Greatest of all times.: Of course everyone knows that this album is a masterpiece. It's Lauyrn's greatest work. Regardless what people say about Lauryn Hill she is remarkable. She's like no other human being ya know. I love the Miseducation of Lauyrn Hill, this is my 5 time buying the cd, the first 2 times someone stole it from me and the other 2, I wore the cds out listening to them so much.
__label__2 Real Hip-Hop flava from a really tight artist...: This album shows that artist can really feel their music instead of just throwing lyrics together. If you feel this C.D., check out the Roots, Tribe called Quest, Black Eyed Peas, and Common.
__label__2 Very Good: I thought this video was very good. I haven't seen other versions, so I can't compare them, but I think it portrays the book excellently (although the book IS of course, better). The first tape is the best. Daniel Radcliffe does a wonderful job playing young David. The plot also follows the book and even the lines in the book very well. The character are cast perfectly. Mr. Murdstone is horrible, Mr. and Mrs. Micawber are exactly how they are in the book! In the second tape, I wish they hadn't cut out the part with the old Doctor, or Tommy Traddles. They focused more on his relationship with Dora and Agnes in the movie, whereas there are many themes going on at once in the book. Also some little things, like Agnes doesn't seem to take quite so kindly to Dora in the movie as she does in the book. But Maggie Smith is excellent as Betsy Trotwood (of course). Overall, this is a fabulous movie. Even if you haven't read the book, you'll want to after you see this.
__label__1 Drags: I enjoyed the beginning of this book, but after a while it just drags. Could have been a nice story in the New Yorker, but as a book it just doesn't cut it. Forced my way to the end.Summary: Couple of guys want to get to this obscure place cause they like the name. Jump through lots of hoops trying to get permission. One of them dies. Permission comes. That's all folks.
__label__2 I'll NEVER buy another Creative Card: Wow! I love this card.Easy to install. Setup on XP was no problem at all.Deep, rich sound (Naked Music has never sounded so good). Played Counter-Strike, footsteps were crisp and clear.I recently purchased a Creative Audigy card; after install somewhat random system crashes plauged my heretofore fine system. I call the crashes somewhat random because they occurred randomly while playing counter-strike and always when I tried to play sound from two different programs.Driver updates didn't help at all.The first thing I did before writing this review was to check those old problems.All gone, simply with a Turtle Beach install.Problem solved and with better sound! Can't beat it. Great card, great price. I love it.
__label__1 horrible: Bought it one and half year ago from Circuit city. Used it mainly for general computer work, not gaming. When I upgraded to a newer machine and try to install it on it, has problem with driver on XP Media Center edition, can not record MIDI from my Yamaha keyboard, and they don't provide support for it any more. What kind of business is this vendor in? Only one and half year later, they don't provide any technical support for their products.
__label__1 What a Shame: There is a lot of background music in this film that never made this collection. Unfortunetly it was also some of the best music from the movie. Why don't they put together "real" soundtracks that include all of the artists used? Instead they always give us their own watered-down choices. Bummer.
__label__2 How can something so simple be so complexly beautiful?: When you play this CD, you will hear no human voices. You'll hear some background sounds of nature -- birds, crickets, the sound of water, the crackling of a fire, etc -- but the main feature is an unimaginably beautiful, masterfully played flute, and some soft percussion that I don't know how to describe. I strongly recommend this CD to anyone! I just played it yesterday after a gap of many years and I'm now kicking myself for having been away from it for so long. It's so beautiful and relaxing, perfect for anyone. There are only four tracks, but they are long, and it's easy to lose yourself into them.
__label__1 Why did I waste my $$$$$?: There is only one good song on this whole album...don't waste your money unless you are super religious-then maybe you can relate to this music.
__label__1 Buy another laminator: I thought this would be a cool laminator to have for my club. Boy was I wrong. My documents were wrinkly. I even ran the documents through a few times. The last time, it ate the carrier. The binder part wasn't very good either. You have to use special folders. I can't believe the manufacturer intended this for the office when it can't even support my little club's laminating needs. It goes to show a good looking product doesn't necessarily delivers.
__label__1 Everybody Bombs Now And Then: Fans either love or hate this album. I fall into the later category for this is without doubt the worst Iggy Pop album, and quite probably one of the worst rock and roll albums ever recorded, bar none. The songs are unimaginative, the musicianship lacking and most amazing of all is that the production is completely incompetent, amazing considering super producer Don Was handles these chores. It surprizing that this didn't completely kill Iggy's recording career. A prime example is the cover of "Shaking All Over". The song shows potential then never takes flight, instead stalling and crashing big time. The Who never imagined the song this way, and with good reason. And its among the better efforts on the album. Try as I might, I just can't listen to more than a few minutes at a time. It is that bad.
__label__2 Great science videos.: My children love these videos. Although they are just 7 and 9 years old, they learn something everytime they watch any of them - and so do I! These videos have a great way of presenting the amazing wonders of nature and God's handywork all around us. We purchased the 19 DVD setMoody Science Classics: 19-DVD Set, and it was well worth it!!!
__label__1 rip off - crooks: Ordered this t-shirt for my son and Old Glory, the supplier, did not send the order and just relinguished the order with no explanation. WARNING..do not buy from Old Glory..it's a waiste of time, they will get your money and then a few months later refund with no explanation. Old Glory is keeping the money in the bank and getting interest for the few months till the refund.
__label__1 Stream of Consciousness style detracts from value: Sorry to part company with the crowd here.THe author's thesis -- that "news" and ad media severely blur the distinction between Real and Unreal -- sounded intriguing, and I wanted to see how the author developed it. Unfortunately, after a few dozen pages, it seemed like the book was a good EXAMPLE of that thesis, and not an elucidation of it. It reminded me of James Joyce, and while Joyce's style can be wonderful for a novel, it kind of stinks for an expository work. My second thought is that publishers have got to stop paying people by the word.The author's point seemed reasonable and based on common-sense -- my quarrel was he could have made it more succinctly, with better support, and with less verbosity.Oh well, enough said.
__label__2 worth watching from start to finish: saw this about 9 times on tvloved it more and more every timeshocking powerful action moviewith small bits of humorlike when Mason Storm gets down on his knees to look like he's playing fair with the robbers in the storeand he still kicks their ass regardless even while on his kneesnow that's funny and powerful. Lebrock is lusciously pretty and very talented. if you like Seagal see Marked for Death, Exit Wounds. and other great titles. I got this on dvd 2 days ago. it's worth the thrills, laughs and excitement every watchsee this movieif you like Kelly Lebrock, then see Weird Science. good and interesting movie
__label__1 Ouch: This movie hurts me to watch it. Steven Segal gets shot up, put in a coma, and then he goes off killing people for revenge. The action is really cheesy, the plot is awful, and the one liners make you want to shoot Segal. Steven Segal can't act.Notice how his movies all seem to have three words "Above the Law" "Hard to Kill" "Straight to Video"....oops.There is a quote in this movie after Steven Segal shoots at a guy's crotch. "I missed. I never miss. They must be smaller than I thought." This line was a mess up, the correct line is: "I missed. I always miss. I must be lamer than I thought."If you wish to suck seven years off of your life, then go ahead, otehrwise steer clear.
__label__1 The worst subtitles awards goes to...: I can't believe the other reviewers were reviewing the same dvd. This is a great movie, don't get me wrong. It's Kurasawa, after all. My one star is for the people at Mei Ah who put out this dvd. Whoever did the subtitle translation did not speak English well enough to graduate from a level one ESL class. The subtitles are truly terrible, sometimes bizarre, and I thought at times I was dreaming I was watching a Monty Python skit. Alas, I was not; this was for real. Such a shame.
__label__2 Soap!: This dvd set is to complete my existing collection. It is one of the most enjoyable shows that I have ever watched! I recommend it to everyone.
__label__2 Good book, but...: It is a very good book. I learned some interesting things, but I guess the subject is more deep. I found the book a little incomplete.
__label__1 A fine game once - but it will not run on modern Macs: This is a PowerPC game. Up through Mac OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard), Intel Macs had "Rosetta," a technology for running PowerPC binaries on Intel machines.Apple discontinued Rosetta in Mac OS X 10.7 (Lion), so there is not way to run this game (or any other PowerPC binaries) without emulating earlier versions of Mac OS X, or booting an earlier version on your Mac (which might not be possible with machines released after Lion). So do not buy it unless you are familiar with these issues.Caveat Emptor.
__label__2 Portable Thoreau: I got this book within a timely manner and am very satisfied with the product and the seller.
__label__1 Oh Please!: Not another one again! I just don't understand Mr Grisham's maniacal obssesion with juries. Who knows how many lawyer and jury books the guy has written? All I know is this: I'm sick and tired of reading about these dumb juries! The Runaway Jury was the only thing that was anywhere near decent that Grisham has poured from his stinking pen. Why does he think the average Joe is interested in judicial matters. I, for one, am not.
__label__2 ALL ARISE! THE HONORABLE JUDGE GRISHAM IS BACK!: After SKIPPING CHRISTMAS and, most recently, BLEACHERS I had begun to believe that John Grisham had been abducted by aliens. But with THE LAST JUROR Grisham comes home to what he knows best: legal literature.THE LAST JUROR tells the story of a young newspaperman who scrapes his funds together, along with help from family to buy The Clanton Times his old paper when he was starting out in the world of journalism. Playing his cards right and reporting on the "dangerous" story of a brutal crime and the trial that ensues, the paper is off and running.But, when perpetrator of the crime is released from prison early and members of the jury start turning up dead, the people of small town Clanton are faced with the vengeance of the criminal and his family.Okay, the resolution of the story is predictable but THE LAST JUROR but the writing is vintage Grisham and marks his almost prodigal return to legal drama and that's certainly worth the wait.THE HORSEMAN
__label__1 The Last Juror: I am a huge fan of John Grisham, have read all of his books, but I have to admit, I have been disappointed with his last few books and The Last Juror takes the cake in that department. It has a great plot, but Mr. Grisham goes no where with it. It starts off very strong, but half way through and all the way to the end, it is awful. I found myself skimming through the pages asking myself "what in the world does this have to do with the story?". Any Grisham fan out there should read it just to read it, but do not expect anything that Grisham's potential has to offer.
__label__1 Very disappointing: Being a huge Grisham fan, I could not wait to read The Last Juror. That quickly turned to being unable to wait to finish it! The book began great, but quickly changed. It just seemed like it did not know where it was going...so many things, too many things were going on. I'd pass on this one.
__label__1 boring: I took this book on vacation expecting a great read and it turned out to be a boring tedious read. If not for the Grisham name this book would not be on any best seller list. Reading this book was a chore not a pleasure. I finished the book and was still waiting for something to happen. Dont waste your time
__label__1 WORST BOOK TO ME; OTHERS FIND IT BEST.: This is the worst book I've ever read because it was advertised as a THRILLER but there was zero suspense. It was such a boring book that it's a wonder that I even finished it. In contrast, I read the DA Vinci Code in 3 days because I simply couldn't put the book down.If the Last Juror had been advertised as a novel about a small Southern town, somewhat like To Kill A Mockingbird, I would have had a different mindset and probably would have enjoyed it more. I read Mockingbird in 3 days also.
__label__1 If You Want to Read About Small Town Living: At first, The Last Juror held my interest like most of Grisham's books do. After the murder trial, which takes place very quickly, the book begins to sag. It becomes a diary of small-town living as seen through the eyes of city slicker Willie Traynor and doesn't pick up much again. What a disappointment.
__label__1 Grisham's not so stunning "comeback": This having been his first legal thriller in a couple years, I was not completely impressed by the movement or character development in this book. I have read all of Grisham's books and would easily place this near the bottom of the list.The initial concept is interesting, but his storytelling was lackluster and characters a bit cliched.I kept thinking the "crime family" resembled the Clampetts and his protaganist was unbelievable at times. A lot of the characters were shallow, and the end was disappointing.If you are going to read this, wait for the paperback or get it from the library.Or just re-read the good ones: A Time to Kill, The Client, The Brethren and The Pelican Brief.
__label__1 Fast reading, barely worth it: Several good court scenes are not enough to salvage this book, as Grisham stretches the plot needlessly through page after page. Actually, although this book is fast-enough reading, you can get through it even faster by checking out the plot summary on the dust jacket. It takes you up to page 291 (out of about 370). Even then, the ending is rather anticlimactic.Hard-core Grisham fans, wanting to preserve their record of reading everything he's written, will have a reason to read this book. The rest of us can surely find better ways to spend even the short time needed to read it.
__label__1 But....!: Rarely have so many cliches about the South been found in one single place. The black lady with 7 children all with Ph.D.'s was too much for me! Her sexually adventurous 8th child was more believable.
__label__1 The Man has lost it: I am still a big fan of Grisham's earlier books, especially Pelican Brief, but I think he's run out of ideas. The Last Juror is tired, boring, derivative and a waste of time.
__label__1 What a disappointment!: John Grisham should stop churning out a book a year and focus on regaining the skills he had when he wrote A TIME TO KILL. Each "novel" has become progressively less satifying. I barely skimmed the last hundred pages of THE LAST JUROR.That's it for me with Grisham books.
__label__1 The worst Grisham book out there!!!: I have read most, if not all, of Grishams books and this one was by far the worst!! I've actually stopped reading it about 3/4 the way through because i have ZERO interest in finishing it. It is very boring, has no suspense, and jumps around a lot. I kept waiting for something to happen and nothing ever did.
__label__1 fast to slow page turner: I've enjoyed a few Grisham novels but this one fell mostly flat for this reader. I guess I prefer the fast paced legal action thrillers that he is known for. It started out great with a horrific murder and dramatic small-town trial but detoured quickly into a commentary of life in Mississippi in the 70's which made it a slow page turner for me.
__label__2 A Character Study: The Last Juror seems to show Grisham's change as an author. In his early works he wrote suspense stories. In The Last Juror the suspense which is secondary to the development of wonderful characters. Miss Callie is a wonderful woman who shows how a powerful force for good can make her whole family better. It is worth reading this book just to meet her.The rest of the small town characters such as Harry Rex and Baggy as well as Will himself and his grandmother are wonderfully drawn.Some reviewers have commented that the book lacked suspense. It seems that Grisham is moving in his work. Rather than a fast moving book such as Angels and Demons with little character development, Grisham is now writing slower moving books with wonderful characters. The Testament and the King of Torts are examples. I think that the new Grisham is every bit as enjoyable as the early Grisham but just a little different.
__label__2 A fun, fast read...: Not familiar with Grisham's work other than the fact that he seems suspiciously prolific, I wasn't expecting anything particularly special. Therefore, I was very plesantly surprised by how well written, compelling and seemingly personal this very entertaining story turned out to be.Great for that long plane ride or to take along on vacation, this smartly written story which says quite a bit about the author's sensitive impressions of the world around him, will keep you interested every chapter of the way.
__label__1 ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ (What a snoozer): I read this book a while ago, but recently thought about it again when someone brought up bad books.I had never read a Grisham novel before this one, and I really expected so much more with all the hype his novels get. As it stands, I have not picked up a Grisham novel since reading this one. What a terrible book. Maybe I missed something, but there didn't seem to be any noteworthy plotlines to warrant writing a book about. I kept thinking, "When is all the action gonna happen? When is all the intrigue and suspense going to take place?" Well, here's the answer: NEVER.I made it all the way to the end of the book, only because I didn't want to think I'd wasted my time reading the earlier chapters. I was going to make it through the book even if it killed me -- but at least that would have been more action than was in the book!
__label__1 Definitely not his best work: I found the storyline of this book to be very interesting, but it kept deviating away from the story and introduced way too many characters, that in my opinion, had little or nothing to do with the story. It's almost as if this was a short story stretched into novel length. Either that or the author was under a deadline to crank the next book out and this is the result. Still overall it wasn't terrible, but still not one of his best works, that's for certain.
__label__1 This is the worst book he has ever written: This is the by far the worst book I have ever purchased. I would love to have my money back. What was John Grisham thinking about, when he wrote this? Obviously, he wasn't thinking. I have read everyone of his books, and if the rest of them are going to be like this, I will have to pass. I am an avid reader of John's; I am the one that can't wait until his next book comes out. I will have to wait next time, because I won't ever read another one like this!!!!!!!!!!!!
__label__1 Grisham has lost his touch....: Drivel and more Drivel....Grisham has lost his touch. You can't write good suspense novels using Harlequin Romance Techniques, filling the pages with unsubstantial filler. If you liked "The Pelican Brief", and was unsatisfied with "The Bleachers", then you and I will agree on this one.
__label__1 Last Juror: Nice book but not up to his previous work. Didn't bother to finish his work. Must have been in a hurry, under pressure from publisher. Would not recommend.
__label__2 Can't Go Wrong!: I've been a DMB fan for quite a while now and have always loved their music, but hearing this CD just made me like the songs even more! I didn't really enjoy bluegrass before hearing this CD, but after hearing this album the only thing I can listen to is this Tribute! This is the best tribute I've ever heard! Every song is done in a way that adds more to the original version with every strum and pick! I would highly recommend this CD to anyone who enjoys Dave Matthews Band, or just bluegrass in general! If you don't believe me then listen to the samples! No matter how long you listen to this Breathe 2: Tribute to DMB you'll understand what I mean, and know that when you stop you'll be thiving for more! This song will become an addiction after you hear it! Do yourself a favor and buy Breathe 2! Trust me on this one, you won't be dissapointed!
__label__2 great: this order came in really fast and it is a classic.. .... ... .. . . . .. ........... .............
__label__1 It tries and tries...: Get a big cauldron. Next, drop in Blade Runner, Laura Croft and Krull. Mix haphazardly. Throw in pointless and gratuitous nude scenes, a pair of boots with six-inch heels and a weak plot. Simmer in a dank, dark place for two hours and you have the equivalent of 'Gene Generation'.While the idea behind the movie shows some minor promise, the constant sub-plots and generic fight scenes throw the whole film off center. Even the obvious physical talents of Bai Ling don't save this film, despite her best efforts. The special effects supporting the film's pseudo-science are ghastly (not in a good way); It looks like a ball of worms threw up on the actors.This is a B-movie, and a poor example to-boot. If not for the driving music score and the sheer beauty of Bai Ling, it wouldn't even rate that high. While not worth the $4 it cost on Amazon, it might be worth $1 on 'RedBox'; but they were too smart to include it in their lineup.
__label__2 Excellent film!: This is what should be coming out of Hollywood now! This film from 1973 is thought-provoking and truly entertaining without any silly special effects to blur the meaning!
__label__1 OMG WHY DID WE EVER THINK THIS RAP WAS COOL?!: TIMOTHY BOTTOMS WAS SO CUTE IN 1973 AND ALL THOSE SHOWER SCENES AND THE 2-3 SWIMMING POOL SCENES. AS OF AUG 2010 THIS MOVIE IS JUST A BIT OF NOSTALGIA, NOT WORTH THE 1:51 LENGTH. SURE GLAD I RENTED VS PURCHASED. RECENTLY I TRIED TO WATCH THE :STRAWBERRY STATEMENT: AND IT WAS SO DATED AND LONG I HAD TO BAIL ON IT. WE WERE INNOCENT AND NAIVE TO BUY INTO THESE FILMS WHEN THEY WERE RELEASED. VERY PREDICTABLE AND FORMULAIC. IMAGINE US COOL KIDS BUYING INTO THE FLIMSY FILMS LIKE THE PAPER CHASE, LOVE STORY, ROMEO AND JULIET, AD NAUSEUM.
__label__2 Call Home Mr. Hart and tell your Mother...........: Everytime I see this film, I get so glad that I dropped out of Law School. Kingfield is alive, well and lurking out there. If you are thinking about going to Law School, see this film if you have time between reading canned briefs. The "Little Questions that tumble in your brain are really there. The Stress over grades is real, the classmates who crash & burn are real. I can not recommend this film too highly to potential 1Ls.
__label__2 Yellow Cab Fever!: Jimmy Fallon is a cop who is such a bad driver he loses his license. Queen Latifah is a cab driver with a souped up Taxi who is a great driver. When Fallon comandeers Latifah's cab to stop a bank robbery, vehicular mayhem and fun break out! Add to the mix the fact the bank robbers are Brazillian Super Models and you have a surreal good time for all!Ignore the critics who have cut this movie to shreds. Its pure escapist fun that rates four stars. Enjoy!
__label__1 ha ha jay!!! This film is crap: I have a friend called Jason o' Byrne and he loves this film... i just wanted to say...Jay this film is REALLY BAD!!!But the models are bleedin animal lookin!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
__label__2 Classic mystery, no major flaws: I think the serial killer plot has been done to death, but back when the Prime Suspect series started, it didn't seem tired.It was very enjoyable to see this program again, so long after it was on television. My only complaint is that it is a bit too long. I think the editing could be tighter. But the plot and the acting can't be faulted.As all the men on the detective squad are so "shocked" at a woman being put in charge of an investigation -- this aspect of the movie seems very dated now.Contrary to another reviewer, I found the DVD quality very good. This was made for TV and one cannot expect the same vivid image of a theatrical feature. Two dual-layer discs for a 210 minute program certainly provides sufficient data rate.Personally, I don't think this has good replay value, unless you intend to wait another ten years to watch it again. As such, the product seems overpriced to me. This is probably a better candidate for a rental.
__label__2 Death at a Funeral: This Comedy is done as only the British can do them. When I first saw it in the Theater, I was not having a good day and didn't want to be there. I found my self laughing a lot. I enjoyed it so much we bought the DVD. We had some friends over and showed it. They loved it. If you are honest, you can recoginze characters from your own experience.
__label__2 Funny Movie: One of the funniest movies I've ever seen. It gets funnier every time I watch it. That's why I purchased a copy for my movie collection.
__label__1 Offbeat Humor: I suppose this type of humor isn't for me as I barely cracked a smile throughout the course of the entire movie. This movie presents you with uncomfortable situations and expects you to laugh nervously.

__label__2 great plot twist: this is one of those movies that after you have watched it you go back and watch it again to see the clues to the ending and plot twist that you missed. i rented from the "redbox" for a buck so i was out nothing if it sucked. but it was a great movie so i bought it in blue ray. remember bruce willis in the sixth sense? it is much like passengers. i don't want to ruin it for you. just buy it, you will love it.
__label__1 Painfully dull, poorly written rip-off *SPOILERS*: Fearless meets the Sixth Sense. Except that Fearless was excellent and the Sixth Sense was good. This movie is bad. Hathaway and Wilson have absolutely zero chemistry and all they do is blab on and on about nothing. The other characters walk in and out then disappear, only we hardly realize that since they're barely on screen for more than a minute at a time. By the time the end hits - all involved are greatly relieved that it's over. For everyone.
__label__2 Ukrainian Tenor in later life: Many of these are from recordings made when this fabulous Ukrainian tenor was old. The Russians worked him well into his 90s. But what a voice. Even though these are from his later life, they are better than nothing. This voice is definitely one of a kind, with emotion so involving that it often draws tears to listeners' eyes. People who have only heard this recording of his voice should get earlier examples. As a younger man Kozlovsky sang with the most incredibly bel canto line squeezing every bit of meaning from the words. When I recently asked a very famous modern Russian baritone what he thought of Kozlovsky's voice, he said he did not like it. As a trained singer, I pressed him to explain further and he just muttered, "He sings in the old way." Whatever the old way is, I want it. It has passion and subtle nuances of feeling, quite different from some present-day singers' tendency to "bellow" while trying to demonstrate drama.
__label__2 Learn CSS In Record Time: If you are new to CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and want to get up to speed in no time, then Russ Weakley's 'Sams Teach Yourself CSS In 10 Minutes' is the perfect guide to accomplishing that task!! In its simplest form, CSS is a way to quickly style web pages and be able to write HTML quickly and not have to worry about keeping track of fonts, colors, etc. while maintaining a uniform style all throughout your web site. If you need to learn how to use CSS quickly and efficiently, I highly recommend this great time from SAMS, you won't be disappointed!!Note: This book is for beginners only, any experienced CSS developer will want to go elsewhere as this book is only for newbies.***** HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
__label__1 5 editors and a proofreader walk into a bar...: (The following comments pertain to the Sixth printing: June 2009 copy of the book)As noted by other reviewers, this version is riddled with numerous (and, in some cases, serious) errors that severely affect the overall worth of the book. In particular, Lesson 19 "Positioning Two Columns with a Header and a Footer" is the victim of an almost complete lack of editing/proofreading. I challenge anyone to follow the directions in this section and come out on the other side with anything that looks like the example in the lesson. The first few chapters are serviceable; the rest is hit or miss from what I experienced. Too bad.
__label__1 service engine light: This cap has caused my 'tighten gas cap' light to alert numerous times. I had a hard time making it fit so i'll not smell gas fumes when opening the driver side door after a trip. If you are buying this product for a 2004 silverado I would consider spending an extra 5 or 10 bucks on a cap that wont give you mentioned problems.
__label__1 I should have believed the other reviewers...: Even after reading the bad reviews this product received from other reviewers I still purchased it. It is pretty easy to set up, but once connected to my PC it had very inconsistent behavior.The device would lose connection to the server after a being idle for 1-2 hours and require a reset.The video performance was awful with the included software. Tversity freeware media server made video performance better, but fast forward and rewind wouldn't work do to some video conversion routines being run by Tversity.Music files would play, and sounded good, but navigating through my music selection was nearly impossible because the music search feature doesn't work. Really... Doesn't work at all.I upgraded firmware and played all sorts of games to try and get the device to work. Finally I gave up and shipped it back to Amazon. The thing was just more trouble than it was worth.FYI: Amazon returns were great.
__label__1 Too poppy: David Bowie seems to have gotten pulled into the candy-coated simplistic pop rock genre that dominates MTV and radios all over the US.His new album lacks the unique and artistic style of usual David Bowie. Too many generic drum and guitar tracks.Don't bother. If you're interested in buying anything, buy Space Oddity, the best album ever made.
__label__2 Let it Open Up: The first listen, I'm betting that you won't get it. You probably won't even remember much except for the striking "Thursday's Child" (it has an awesome video too once you realise the theme). So give it a few listens and it will bloom. It's a fine finale to his "trilogy". Earthling is definately the peak of energy but as "Hours" now comes after, it chills you out in the reflective mood.Maybe not among his classics but very enjoyable and worth it.
__label__1 bad: previous review was never printed. I will condense... This was trash. Too bad. I WAS a great bowie fan.
__label__2 If I'm dreaming all my life....: What a comeback! OK, I know that Bowie never really disappeared from the scene, but he's been foundering for some time. This will hopefully signal th end of that period, as it is a really good recording. I'm not sure how many people will find all the metaphors in here, perhaps there aren't even supposed to be so many, but I just kept finding them. Added, many of the lyrics just fit my life right now, and the questions I find myself asking more and more--ie; "were we meant to last"? Were we? Whether we were or not, this CD should--at least, for a darned long time.
__label__2 Loved it!: Reading through the table of contents of the book I had this sense of familiarity. The first few chapters have been titled and themed in such a way that it bring to mind the creation story found in the Bible. Granted, that's not what this book is about and I don't believe the story of creation found in the pages of Genesis is meant to be taken as literal scientific fact, however, I appreciate the sense of wonder and significance the framing gives to the beginning of time (even though, taken as is, it's not as if the beginning of our universe was lacking in wonder). Still, by borrowing a bit from the structure of the Genesis story, I think Ackroyd gives a bit of familiarity to the history and science he's sharing. Ackroyd weaves together science, a storytellers skill, easy page layout, and fascinating pictures and illustrations for a good overview of the very beginning of our planet to the final emergence of Homo sapiens.
__label__2 K&N air filter: This product really allows my suzuki gsxr to breathe better - Its a great item and i will be sure to recommend you to other bike riding friends of mine.
__label__2 good breather: its a different shape than the stock filter for my 82' xv750 but the holes line up fine and it fits well in my airbox,i definitely notice the increased performance from better airflow, and its reusable
__label__2 A great filter that gave me extra power: I bought this for my Suzuki Boulevard C50 because I wanted a washable filter that lasted a long time. I heard people talking about how a K&N filter gave them extra power. I didn't really believe all that, but after I installed this filter on my bike, there was a small yet noticeable increase in power. I am happy! Extra performance on a washable filter that will last me for the life of the bike.
__label__2 Good Purchase Experience: The filter was exactly as identifed when ordered. It was shipped promptly and packaged well enough to protect it during shipment.
__label__2 Great price: 2010 Honda Goldwing very good price for a performance filter that can be washed and reused. Plus I believe that K&N filters flow more air.
__label__2 Not great but is okay: All right, Adjust well on the bike, however I think the original has a best presentation and even better fit, I should clarify that there is nothing wrong with this device and it is too early to assess its performance, is currently installed and working well in general I have no complaints.
__label__1 Didn't fit properly.: I purchased the K&N HA-6003 as a replacement for the stock filter in my 2003 Honda CBR600RR. The fit of the K&N was poor at best. I did manage to get it in, but not without considerable effort. Now that it's in the bike, I am a bit worried about it sealing properly. If I had it to do again, I would go with a different hi-flo aftermarket filter, or the OEM.
__label__2 K&N's for every ride I own...: I always purchase K&N air filters for every vehicle I own, I didn't know that Amazon had the best price for them. I will definitely be using Amazon to purchase all my K&N stuff in the future.
__label__1 Wouldn't work: The sharpener sat around for a month or so before I used it. When I went to use it, it didn't even have sufficient power to sharpen a pencil. Amazon wouldn't accept a return because I was out of the warranty period.
__label__1 not heavy duty!: This sharpener is a joke. I have a small school and need to sharpen 10-20 pencils a day. Bought this "heavy duty" model, however, it shuts off after sharpening 4-5 pencils! Don't waste your money, folks. I wish someone could steer me to a really heavy duty product.....
__label__1 Don't Buy This!: Expensive as it is, I thought I'd have something that would give me no trouble. It eats pencils.The led gets broken and stuck in the machine, not allowing any further sharpening and you can't even take it apart and fix it.An unfortunate waste of time and money.JN
__label__1 mediocre: In my opinion, no movie does any book justice. The book version is always better. This one is not a great remake of the book. I bought another version that was better. Would not highly recommend.
__label__1 This is NOT the SHELL SEEKERS: This film bears only a passing resemblance to Rosamund Pilcher's THE SHELL SEEKERS. The director watered down the book's powerful plot to weak tea and you will barely recognize the characters. Angela Lansbury does her best but cannot help the tepid writing. The casting was almost completely off the mark - Danus is particularly badly cast. I expected a better film from the Hallmark Hall of Fame. This was so bad it took me 3 trys to get through to the end. Don't buy it. In fact, it's hardly worth renting. Reread the book instead.
__label__1 quiet. then loud.: This recording takes the dynamics to the point where some passages are barely audible and you have to strain to hear them and then as you're straining and your ears are completely open and unprotected you get hit with the frying pan. It's like being abused with music. An anxiety inducing recording. Tried listening to it numerous times, now I'm either donating it to the library or perhaps simply throwing it as far away from my person as I can without damaging my rotator cuff.
__label__1 delta sigma book: Hi,I bought this book sometime last month. Received it couple of weeks back. It was delivered promptly, but the book print quality seems to be bad. In fact it looks like a fake! Looks more like a photocopy of the original book. So much for paying this kind of money to buy the 'original'.
__label__2 Fun to dance to: This collection of music is so cool. It gives you a quick glimpse of alot of different artists. It has nice catchy tunes all through the cd.
__label__1 One of the Top Ten Worst Movies of All Time: I am still in shell-shock that people of quality such as Chloe Sevigny & Stephen Rea could even finish filming this piece of dog doo-doo, this thing is beyond horrid - there aren't enough words to convey how much this thing stunk! The movie starts out ok, steadily begins to make less & less sense, becomes just utterly non-sensical, and THEN takes a very sharp turn into pure absurd idiocy - and WAY over-the-top gore. NONE of it making any sense, mind you. NONE OF IT. Not the time structure of events, not the things taking place, and most assuredly not the moronic ending. I was quite angry that I'd spent $1.08 at my discount video to even rent it.
__label__1 Poorly Done!: Fist of that version of the national anthem was the pitts!I mean all of those train and carrying on was ridiculous! First off no one will and ever sing the National Anthem like Whitney Houston! Beyonce did an alright job! People are making that up to be something its not!Thank You for your time and consideration!!Sincerly Yours,A Music Major at Florida Stae University!
__label__2 Short stories for philosophers, literature snobs, and lovers of the unusual: Albert Camus, born in Algeria in 1913, won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1957 and died three years later, but his writings live on. This collection of six unusual, strange-endinged stories will probably be of interest to a wide range of short story fans. Sometimes seemingly vague and symbolic (and with odd titles and endings), they are thoroughly enjoyable and readable. Though similar in complexity, subject matter and settings vary greatly: a woman joins her fabric-selling husband on a business trip, a detongued former missionary awaits his replacement, barrel makers strike, a prisoner is foisted on a schoolmaster, an artist works amidst ever-changing chaos, and an engineer visits inhabitants near the site of a future dam. Exile and the Kingdom is an excellent, strange, brief book. Other strange short stories: Blind Willow, Sleeping Woman by Haruki Murakami.
__label__1 Can you say cardboard with cheese flavor: Like the other Doctor Kracker Snack I reviewed they are as hard as a rock. Reminds me of pasteboard with cheese flavoring.
__label__2 Personal and universal: If you love Paul Williams and if you love Dylan this is an unbeatable experience, focusing as it does on what some might call "lost years" of highs and lows of Bob's career. It is all the same for Paul Williams who takes it ALL in and lovingly dissects every speck of Dylan's output. Paul Williams was a lone voice in the wilderness back in the "Dylan: What Happened" days so this serves as an extension of that important book.
__label__1 Drew Barrymore has made her "opps!" movie once again: Drew Barrymore has been having a hard time making good movies after making the the movie "Ever After" which i thought was a OKAY movie,which i gave **.but home fries was a horrible movie with a messed up script and plot.plus i thought it was too dark to be a comedy.*
__label__1 BORING!! But barley okey: This is the dulliest unsatisfiting of all time . Even though Drew Barrymore is in it . It still doesn't steal the show . The middle was okey but the rest was just plain Garbage .
__label__1 Home Fired!: It is a very good thing that Drew Barrymore did not choose this film to kick start her career. This film was a bomb from the word go. It was overly campy and completely unbelieveable. While the premise of the story is somewhat interesting, the depiction is absolute blah! Do yourself a favor, if you must see this film ... RENT IT FIRST!
__label__2 Best TV Series EVER EVER EVER EVER EVER: As the cover said, this is the TV series that still stands as the benchmark for others. Knock-out performances by the incomparable Laurence Olivier, Jeremy Irons and last but not least in my opnion the best character ever put down on film: Sebastian by Anthony Andrews.Well, all will know this story about romantic yearning, friendship, loss and mostly the English charm of it.In a concluding scene with Charles Ryder he was told by an old studentfriend that that charm (of Sebastian) was dangerous, and that it almost took the best of him.And that might be true in a general sense: once seen it is hard to come to terms with it, first that this series is finite, and second the tragic fate of indeed the most charming person on screen yet, Sebastian, that sort of friend that we are all looking for, but who is so hard to find!
__label__2 Great Art based on Great Art: This production need not be limited to "ever made for TV." This is one of the greatest and most profound movies ever made. Every element of every scene is superb and riveting. I watched it again, twenty years after first seeing it, and enjoyed it even more with my Southern Baptist wife who kept insisting "let's watch just one more episode"!This story is esentially Catholicism talking to itself through both the main characters and the sheer majesty of the Brideshead Estate (Castle Howard). This work is epically and evengelically Catholic. Anyone who sees "Brideshead Revisited" will find his tongue stopped about pedophile priests and "Hitler's pope" because his mind has been slowly, platonically wrestled around to see the glory of God's church on earth. Waugh is a midwife first, author second; and I would say the same of Mortimer, who made this production happen. Thank God for both men and for this production.
__label__2 it doesn't ever get better than this...: they show this on PBS sometimes so even if you choose not to purchase the best drama ever to grace the 21 inch screen you can still see it. it is so far above anything else to first appear on television you may wonder how it ever was produced! perhaps that is a story in of itself. in any case it is truly one of a kind and to not see it would be like never seeing Dr. Zhivago or Casablanca or any of the other larger than life tragic love stories of this century.
__label__1 Brides head revisited: This product was ompossible to watch the sequence of episodes was all mixed upFor example episode 9 was only able to be played by pressing episode11 and so on.When there were three episodes on a disc the middle episode would not respondAnd could not be played.I was amazed to receive such an inferior product from amazon.
__label__1 Blu-Ray version washed out and colorless: This is one of my favorite tv shows of all time, but I have never been so disappointed in any product as I was with this one. Don't bother buying the Blu-Ray version. It has been remastered in some way for high definition that results in a flat, colorless picture that is overly bright and has little detail. (I had the same problem with the new version of Upstairs-Downstairs, also by Acorn Media.) I watched about fifteen minutes of it before I gave up and got out the DVD version and watched it on my up-converting DVD player. With the DVD version, the picture is a little blurry, but at least there is color and detail, and the picture is not flat. If you already have it on DVD, leave well enough alone. If you don't have it at all don't buy the Blu-Ray version, invest in a $50 up-converting DVD player instead.
__label__2 As wonderful as I remembered it!: Can't go wrong with the content. Amazing acting, photography, storyline. Only complaint is a couple of minutes of slightly blurry picture on one of the discs. So glad to own this for my viewing whenever I want.
__label__1 Bird is always bird: Its ok for a single DVD. However, if you are looking for an extended documentary on his life, buy the big 4 or 5 DVD volume by Ken Burns, there's nothing like it, and it spends quite a lot of time on Bird. Its a must-have for jazz fans.
__label__1 Beware of Seller: I ordered this book mid-April for Mother's Day. It did not arrive at the estimated time. I waited another week then contacted the dealer. They said I needed to wait the maximum shipping time before they could resolve the issue. It still did not arrive so I contacted them again and they stated that they would send the book now. I waited again and it still didn't arrive so I sent another email. Amazon has issued a refund because the seller now says that the book is apparently out of stock. I feel they should have said that from the beginning.
__label__2 A good starter book to help focus on WWII books of interest: I really liked this book. I use it to further add books to my Wishlist. Dunnigan's mini-summaries of included books are loaded with details. I have several books by Dunnigan all of which I have enjoyed reading. Some other reviewers have provided less than glowing reviews of some of his books. I try to keep things in perspective so flaws noted are not ignored. Given his background and experiences, I suspect James Dunnigan might be a very interesting author to meet in person.
__label__2 Schiller: This is the second edition of this book. The Translator spent years on researching and putting Schiller's works together. He worked closely with the Germans to make sure that he got this right. However, the second edition has the Translator's very own poem; The Translators Apology To The Reader as he had to make some corrections in his own translating. Schiller was a controversy of sorts in his time. Many of his poetry has to do with his one love Laura, the lady who first captured his heart, and had great impact on his life.
__label__1 What a disappointment...: I agree wholeheartedly with the first reviewer- what is the point of this boxed set? I have YesYears as well, and almost every other Yes cd. This boxed set adds very little that is new, and might only be worth buying for someone without any Yes cd's, or who is new to listening to the band. Other boxed sets (Jethro Tull, Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, Eric Clapton, etc.) were done very well by their respective record companies, and make a lot of sense.The one good thing about this box set is that (supposedly) all the music was remastered. If Rhino goes back and re-releases some of Yes's albums with bonus tracks (as they are doing for the band Chicago), I would definitely be interested in buying that.
__label__2 YesYore: Judicious choice of tracks by Steve Howe makes a seemingly inessential purchase (how many best-of's/repackagings from the band in recent years?) hard to pass up. Disdaining the live tracks, solo meanderings (The Fish?), and subpar B-sides that afflicted Yesyears, this 6-hour package sounds and looks great. Nothing (incl. America) is abridged, and liner notes make a strong case for Yes rivaling King Crimson as musical pioneers. Packaging, as always with Rhino, is exemplary.
__label__1 NOT ORIGINAL ARTISTS: This is NOT a compilation of Original Releases. It is a DEMO of publishing co. Soundtracks.
__label__2 Barbara Crampton looks great in leather!: Great horror movie! Jeffrey Combs does very well in this one
__label__1 I'm unhappy !!!!: I didn't receive this item. I live in Brazil and I asked to a friend of mine, who was in the United States, to bring it to me. The package was sealed, but the blades were not inside.
__label__2 Fantastic but: The design of this basketball system is fantastic. It is so easy to move and so easy to raise or lower the backboard. It is sturdier than most movable systems and with the 4 wheels and the leaver action you can easily move it from one place to the other without emptying the reservoir. If it is a windy day you can easily lower the back board. Now that I have raved about the product let me give you the negative, if you are not mechanically inclined, do not even attempt to put this together. The directions are terrible and there are a lot of moving parts. After putting it together there are a lot of left over nuts and bolts and you wonder what you have forgotten, but the directions are very bad so you had to guess at what they meant. So I recommend that you hire someone to put this together which is what we had to do to get this put up. Took the person many hours to get it together and he was not working by an hourly rate.
__label__2 Pure magic: Morgan LLywelyn is one the most gifted writers writing today and "Lion of Ireland" is her masterpiece. You feel her passion and the love she has for the Irish in her words and her unique storytelling talent makes this book one of the best books I have ever read.
__label__2 A truly magical book: This book is a master piece. This was the best book I ever read and I should know I'm only 13 but I've read more than my share of books. This should be turned into a movie, Brian of Boruma makes William Wallace look like a child. And if they're lookin for somebody to have a small part like Turlough I'll gladly play the part.
__label__1 Trite and predictable: I was excited to read this book based on the reviews, my love of history. I was extremely disappointed. The characters here are one dimensional, uttering predictable catch-phrases, and are basically uninteresting. I got through about 200 pages and couldn't even finish. The main character is increadibly driven, and consequently his reactions throughout the story become entirely predictable. He has no depth and the author doesn't create any kind of sympathy, empathy, or interest between the character and the reader. I really didn't care what happened to him or any of the characters in the book. I think I'll stick with Bernard Cornwell, or Sharon Kay Penman.
__label__1 A big disappointment: I disagree with the reviewer who characterized the author as a poor writer. She isn't. The problem is the content. After reading the first 90 pages, I put the book down, finally admitting to myself that I really didn't care what Ms. Powell thought or opined about anything. I was finding her blog-turned-book to be just one more rant from a neurotic New Yorker, a genre for which my tolerance peaked several years ago. It was never that high to begin with.Unfortunately, a friend had given me the book, thinking I'd enjoy it because of my fondness for Julia Child. Maybe that contributed to my reaction to the author. Juxtaposing herself with Julia Child invites one to think about issues of character, style and substance. On all those measures, Ms. Powell suffers.My recommendation: see the movie, but forget the book.
__label__1 Catastrophic Hissy Fit: How do you take an idea with so much promise and turn it into an excruciating read? You allow someone like Julie Powell to write about it, that's how. Never in my entire life have I found the narrator of a book more irritating than I did Powell. More a filthy-mouthed diatribe of her whiney ways than the entertaining cookalogue it should have been, had Julia Child lived to read "Julie & Julia," undoubtedly she would have deemed it just as disrespectful and non-serious as she did Julie and her "project." I wanted to like this book; I really did. In the end, however, it's nothing more than something Powell claims to have regularly on subway platforms: a catastrophic hissy fit. One can only hope the movie fares better, but then again, it could hardly do worse. Two stars for managing to steer unlikeability and awful writing to the top of the bestseller chart. Kudos for that amazing feat at least.
__label__1 POLITICAL ONLY: WHY DID SHE FEEL THE NEED TO KNOCK REPUBLICANS AT EVERY TURN? A REAL SIGN OF LOW INTELLIGENCE. SPOILED BOOK COMPLETELY. SHE IS VERY OPINIONATED IN ALL HER THOUGHTS AND FILTHY TALK TO BOOT...THINKS SHE IS SOPHISTICATED...BAH.BAD BOOK.
__label__1 Terrible: I found this book to be simply unreadable. Too much trite dialogue and a very unlikable, whiny author. I muddled through to page 87 and had to put it down. If you're interested in Julia Child, I highly recommend My Life in France by Julia Child--excellent!
__label__1 A Rambling Mess: I picked this book up with an expectation of a fun memoir read. The premise was unique...cooking all 524 recipes from Julia Child's Art of French Cooking. I expected a fun romp of cooking mishaps, triumphant cuisines, interesting tales of kitchen disasters and enjoyments but instead it was nothing but a misguided attempt at a so-called memoir. Very, very disappointing.
__label__1 Movie better than the book: I have to say for the first time in my life the movie is way better than the book, it is totally disjointed and full of unnecesary profanity. The author comes across as very immature and a total whiner. Don't bother buying it, the movie is much more enjoyable.
__label__1 Stay as a Blogger: This is a terrible book. Julie Powell is, on her own admission, not a good cook and the text proves it. And on the evidence of this book she is not a good writer either. I am accustomed to swearing (it is generally a substitute for vocabulary), but the use of foul language throughout is distasteful. Perhaps her moment of fame will inspire her. I doubt it. She should stick to blogging. Poor Julia - passe she may be, but she must be turning in her grave at this travesty.
__label__1 Profanity detracts from material: I can count on one hand the books I have thrown away in my lifetime of 47 years. I treasure books and respect them, but unfortunately this one had to be kept away from anyone else. I didn't get past the first ten pages. The level of profanity was so distracting that I couldn't focus on what the author was saying. Her writing is rich, and I appreciate that. But the book is now smoldering in our burn barrel outside.
__label__1 too much julie not enough julia: The politics gets really old really fast as do the day to day lives of the self absorbed and rather dull cast of characters. I really wanted to like the book, but, like a number of other reviewers, I could only make it part way through. PS. enough with the F-word already. It may be hip, but it's jarring especailly when used incessently.
__label__1 Don't Buy This Just Because You Liked the Blog: I read the Julie/Julia Project blog occasionally and enjoyed it. I thought that the book would be similar, but it wasn't. I don't object to irreverent opinions and random stories in a foodie memoir, but she took out too much of what made the blog fun and what she replaced it with lacks wit and charm. Powell's writing feels forced and her contrived expositions of how hip, liberal, and shocking she is/wants to be pall quickly.
__label__1 I did not like this book: After reading some of the reviews I see that there seem to be two sets of camps regarding this book: folks either loved it or hated it. I guess I'll have hang out with the haters. Julie Powell comes off as an extremely unpleasant, immature little princess. It's a good idea: a year cooking from Julia Child's French cooking book but it's just so hard to read. The whole thing is snark and whine and it tiresome after a few chapters.
__label__1 Don't waste your time or money on this awful book!: Very poorly written book. It's all over the place. The "f" word seemed to be thrown in simply to fill space. At times I didn't have the slightest clue what she was talking about. She tried to be funny - and failed miserably. And besides being boring and poorly written she frequently takes cheap shots at republicans, which were just distracting and irritating.Simply put this book is nothing like I was expecting and I am so glad that I got a copy from the library and didn't contribute one dime to this woman's bank account. I returned it to the library the very next day - unfinished.Very disppointing, this was such a good idea for a book and a movie, but Julie Powell just wasn't up to the task...at least not to my standards.
__label__1 I tried: I wanted to like this book. I've curled up with it a couple times now, thinking that I was just being difficult and should give it another chance. I absolutely love Laurie Colwin's writing, surely I should enjoy this. But I just didn't. I can't explain why sometimes cranky writing is warm and endearing and sometimes it isn't, but something is lacking in this book. And while it's true that she tracks down such things as bone marrow and squab for authenticity's sake, she misses another recipe's texture completely because she doesn't have a cooking thermometer. Surely every grocery store with even a handful of implements for sale offers a cooking thermometer (probably for less than the cost of a squab)?
__label__1 Narcissistic Hipsters Should Cook, Not Write: After seeing the movie, I knew what I was in for when I read the book. Julia Child is a survivor, a truly original pioneer of the old school, disciplined and humble. She is everything that hipster bloggers, like the author, is not - whiny, narcissistic, entitled, yet full of illusions of her own grandeur and hero-worshipping of everything "vintage" and iconic - in this case it's Julia Child. I wasn't surprised Child responded the way she did - who would want to be used as a marketing gimmick and turned into a cultural totem object by a wimpy, girl-woman who has the life experience of an ameoba? Julia Child must have sensed this and stayed away.
__label__1 disappointing: I love both cooking and reading blogs, so I thought this book would be a natural fit for me. Unfortunately, I didn't enjoy much about it. The writing is so-so, and the author's "deep thoughts" that come from her cooking experiences are pretty banal and predictable.I did get a laugh that there are book club questions included at the end - I can't imagine that any book club would select this book - there is just not a lot of substance here. I'd give this one a miss.
__label__1 Just OK: The character was self-absorbed past distraction. In fact, she was so distracted that most of the time she could not get out of her own way. And where was she going? And why do I want to read about it? I also found it difficult relating Julia Child's "diary" excerpts to the life-experiences of Julie that they were spliced into. If it wasn't a book club book, I wouldn't have finished it.
__label__1 Horrible Recipes Made Bearable: As I'm more than halfway through this book I might as well finish. Julie's less than amusing encounters with lobster slaughter, for example, are rendered with just enough humor to make her tales palatable. I'd forgotten how unbelievably disgusting a great many of Julia's Child's recipes were until slogging my way through the diary version of Julie's life with Julia from hoof to flailing claw to beaten lettuce. A slight exaggeration, but not by much.Proof that the human species hasn't advanced all that far on a culinary level, if we're supposed to be amused by all this.
__label__1 Don't waste your money: Please don't waste your time or money purchasing this book. Our book club decided to read it based on it's "good" reviews. Only one person out of six finished it (just to get it done). The language is foul and the story is boring and drags on, which makes it difficult to follow and finish. Two stars is being generous.
__label__1 Ick, Ick, Ick: My book club is reading this book. A friend loved it and said it was a quick easy read. I hate it, hate it, hate it and have from the first few pages. The main character is boring, profane (for no apparent reason except lack of class) and whines about everything. The only thing I've enjoyed is the tiny bit about Austin, where I grew up. I adored Julia Child who was one of a kind. The author should be ashamed using her singular greatness to make money with this crass garbage.
__label__1 I bought this for a laugh...: This is just hilarious. Mary-Kate and Ashley releasing their Greatest Hits 3 album- what could be funnier?! I don't really know whether to give this one star for musical ability, or 5 stars for comedy. I guess I'll just go with one star...If you want to laugh, but this album.
__label__2 Must Have for Newborns: This was by far our most useful baby gift-- it helped our baby get to sleep and even saved our sanity a few times. Nothing calms a crying newborn better than a good swaddler. At first it's a little tricky to figure out how the velcro fits together, but once you've tried it a few times, it's easy. Just buy 2 or 3 so you won't go into a panic when it's in the wash.
__label__1 Simply put - does not work: I read Dr. Karp's book and decided to buy a swaddling blanket. After doing a lot of research and reading a ton of good reviews on this one, I decided not to spend the $30+shipping on the miracle blanket, but get this instead. Boy, was that a bad decision. We tried a few times, and my baby unswaddled herself within seconds! Granted, we had a big and healthy baby, who was strong, so maybe if your baby is tiny and/or weaker than an average newborn for whatever reason, it might work nicely for a while, but otherwise, don't waste your time with this. I ended up buying the miracle blanket, and that WORKED! Do yourself a favor, spend the extra $20 and buy the miracle blanket. I could have avoided many sleepless nights if I did that earlier!
__label__1 Not for Baby Houdinis!: I was reluctant to invest in a blanket specifically for swaddling, but after a few weeks of making due with regular blankets, I tried the SwaddleMe wrap. While it is reasonably priced, cute and easy to use, my little guy found it easy to "escape", both from the size-appropriate blanket, and from the smaller size. I just couldn't keep his arms secure or tightly wrapped. Swaddling at night makes all the difference for my baby, so I'll continue to do it, but I'm back to my low-tech system: receiving blanket and tape.
__label__1 worse than a straight jacket: My baby hates this even though he loves being swaddled. Definitely the worst baby product I've purchased.
__label__2 helps baby sleep better!: very nice. easy to use. highly recommended. baby always seemed to manage to escape his blankets- this he can not get out of :)
__label__1 Too big: Blanket was too big in the large size for 21 inch baby at 9 lbs. They have 2 sizes but no chart to figure out which size you need. The velcro tabs are small and she could easily slip out. I'm waiting until the baby is bigger to use it, but we're in the third month and still waiting. Other reviews have said the small was too small, so I'm not sure. Would recommend Miracle Blanket; costs more but is one-size fits all and is adjustable as they grow. Just don't put it in the dryer...
__label__1 Ok, but there are better swaddlers: I have used the small and large size of these swaddlers and wouldn't waste my money again. I have to wrap my son so tight for these to work, that I won't be using them anymore. Too many nights he wakes because his hands escape. It's not worth the disrupted sleep. I liked that these were more affordable than the other "miracle" brand, but ended up wasting more money because these didn't work for me. Other swaddling blankets, such as the "miracle" blanket do not solely rely on wrapping tight, but also have other tucking aspects that make it effective. If you have a Houdini baby, don't waste your money.
__label__1 Keep it tight!: Make sure its as tight as possible, otherwise the babies head can get inside and the baby could soffocate. The back/side should be totally covered in velcro so that you can stick the tabs where you need them
__label__2 nice gift: This is a very uplifting mix of Christmas music. If you like Celtic music, then you will appreciate the various tunes.
__label__2 SMALLER than what it says on the prod description.: The product came promptly and I like it. It was way cheaper than any of the big hardware chains and even one huge lumber and hardware store that caters to contractors. Item has good weight on it so it does not feel or look cheap. One thing I DID NOT like was that it was SMALLER than what the product description states. This is 1 inch in diameter NOT 1 1/4 inches. Other than that I am happy with it.
__label__2 oil rubbed door knobs: perfect size and color to replace the chrome ones when we did the redecorating in our bathroom -- lots of browns, copper and rust colors .... perfect!
__label__2 look nice: they do look like the could cost you alot more but the quality really shows after time... the finish does remove from the knob over time but for me it wasnt a big deal since it was for a basement... but if you need if for a upscale kitchen i would pass but for a back room or an old drawer its perfect
__label__1 Never arrived: I ordered this so I could watch it for a paper. Too bad it never arrived and I had to scramble at last minute to find a copy.
__label__1 Made in China; that says it all!: Dont' bother with these rotors! They warped after barely 300 miles. I was assured by PowerStop that their products were NOT from China, yet after peeling off a label on the box, it was clearly marked, "Made in China". So either these are NOT really from PowerStop, or I was lied to.
__label__1 N.G. For TIVO: I agree with other users.... If you read the TIVO recommended wireless network adapters, this adapter will not work in TIVO because AMAZON is going to ship you out V.2. V.2 does not work, and V.1 is not longer made. I suggest you just order the TIVO brand.... that's what I did, after trying numerous others.and YES, I have a brand new unit with the latest software, that's NOT the issue.
__label__1 i dont know if it works...: worked but a weird deal, not sure if my computer was the problem or this thing....i cant say it is bad or good sorry...
__label__1 Doesn't work and very frustrating: It worked at first but the connection kept dropping. Then every time you try to open the wizard it flashes on the screen for a second and disappears. You can't get the wizard to stay on screen for more than a second so can't change any settings. A total waste of time and money - don't bother with it.
__label__1 Doesn't work and merchant won't allow returns: This product is horrible. We own a Belkin and it works, unlike this wireless adapter. I thought I'd try this one since it's smaller and a bit less money, but it doesn't doesn't pick up any signal from our modem, and the modem is across the hall in the next room. In addition, I bought it from State Street Deals, and they won't let us return it because it's been opened. How else would we find out it doesn't work? Definitely NOT a great product, or merchant. I'd avoid both at any cost.
__label__1 Wow! What a piece of junk!: I just spent hours of frustration trying to get this thing to work reliably. Never got it working correctly. Netgear won't just let you install the drivers and be done with it. No, they force you to install their bloated and buggy configuration software which doesn't play well with Windows XP(apparently). So, after much cursing and hair-pulling, I took it back and exchanged it for a comparable Linksys adapter. Now all is right again in my universe. If you are looking for a USB wireless adapter, do yourself a favor and go back to the search page and type in L-i-n-k-s-y-s.
__label__1 Don't waste your money!: Although I am very happy with the other NetGear products I own I have to say that this adapter is a waste of money. It's easy to set up (I'm running Windows 2000) and starts working at first, but after less than a half hour, it flickers out and stops working entirely.I have a NetGear router and laptops using NetGear PCI wireless cards which work well, but this product is a dog. I second one of the earlier reviewers who mentioned how hot the item gets after a short time in use. My guess is that it has a design flaw that causes it to overheat and stop working. They should really go back to the drawing board on this one.
__label__2 Delicious: Our Shiba Inu, Maya, loves these. First and foremost, the packaging says Made in the USA and that makes them worth buying right there. They are quite light and airy (being freeze dried) and are easy to crunch or gum for older dogs. A definite go to treat for any canine companion.
__label__2 We all love this!: This is an excellent treat for my cats, all natural with only one ingredient. I use this to bribe them into letting me brush their teeth. It might be pricey, but a little goes a long way.
__label__1 No Mre sequals!: This movie did not fill it's axpectations, it was horible! I'd like to see the producers come up with another one, how in a million years would peter survive if EVERYONE knows it's him?, He doesn't have to be a perfect gentlemen but taking off his mask to everyone he meets, the whole movie was moronic I would of enjoyed it if that weird gravity thing erased people's memory and, that Auto guy could control his arms after all he wasn't even evil!
__label__1 Big Fat Letdown: After the amazing Spider-man, which was full of action, adventure, and intrigue, Spider-Man 2 falls flat. The commercial and ads make it look like it's another Spider-Man, but be warned, it's not. The action scenes you see in the commercials are the only scenes with anything interesting shown in them, and most of the movie is just Peter Parker sitting in his aunt's house drinking tea, and/or hanging out with Mary Jane, who has a more boring character than she did in the first one. This movie has the audacity to call itself an action movie, but it is more of a teen angst drama, with one or two scenes of action. In fact, I do not see why this movie got a PG-13 rating for violence. It's closer to a G. This movie is a BIG letdown after the first one, and it will not be on anyone's future list of favorites (or at least, I hope not).
__label__1 I wanted to like it I really did!: I thought it was slow and predictable. Tobey was good as Spiderman but his character seemed a bit whiny and was too much of an idiot. I don't get it why everyone likes Spiderman so much it's not that good of a movie. I didn't like the first one much either both Spiderman movies suck and I hope the 3rd one will be better but it will probably be the same as the first two. It's in my opinion if I didn't like it don't get mad why I didn't like it I just didn't like it.
__label__2 Spiderman 2: Grade A+: This film is quite possibly the best film sequel ever made. It outshines the 2001 original. The action, special effects, acting, story, and the villain are all improved. The action is this film is heart pumping, non stop, and fun to watch. The special effects have greatly improved over the past three years, especially in the aerial shots of New York City. The acting in the film is better especially in Mary Jane's character. The story is definately improved, due to the emphasis on Harry Osborne's hate of Spiderman, and Peter Parker having to juggle his life around being a superhero. Another great aspect of this film is the new villain, Doc. Oc. This villain you can hate and sympathize with unlike the totally sinister green goblin. The film's ending sets up perfectly for a third installment to this wonderful film series that will last for generations.
__label__2 Great movie!: I thought it was a great movie. Personally i think it's the best out of the three out today.
__label__1 Marketing really does work.: I can understand just wanting to watch a trashy action film but this movie was just annoying. Tobey Maguire did his best to convince us that he really is a wet noodle. His snivelling self-conflicted, let-me-show-you-my-feminine-side routine was a bit overplayed. For a minute I thought that it was the exact character that he played in Cider House. Somehow I couldn't help imagining Roger Ebert with a toothy grin, ramming popcorn in his mush while fawning over Maguire's touching portrayal of a superhero in conflict. Seriously, this was a casting disaster that the marketing department saved. A few reviews ago somebody mentioned "not seeing enough of maquire's body." Was that a joke? After seeing him in this film I am ready to concede that there is a place for steroid use in this world. Reading these reviews I'm suspecting that the production company is paying people to write reviews on amazon.
__label__1 smallville anyone?: I must admit the sequel is bucketloads better than the first. That said, the rest sucks. Spiderman is a total copy cat of Superman and Smallville. The villians and the characters are total ripoffs. Money wasted. Do yourself a favor and watch a better movie. Make it Superman.
__label__2 Spider 2 Strikes Gold!: This movie has an excellent story (better than the first). First rate acting, direction, and special effects. In my estimation, this is better than the first!
__label__1 Don't listen to the other reviewers it sucked!: I did not like Spiderman 2 at all (...)! It was like watching a soap opera movie or something with no action in it. All there is, is just graphics there's not any fighting in it. Doc Ock wasn't a villian at all he was just tryin to go after Spiderman for what he did to him and all. I don't really see Tobey Maguire as Spiderman that much he just wasn't right at all. Kirsten Dunst was allright as MJ and she's georgeous. I wouldn't mind having a girl like that. James Franco would have been a better Spiderman than Tobey Maguire. Why did they had to choose Tobey? I hate Tobey Maguire and all of his movies they suck and he's also boring who never says a word. But anyways don't waste your money on this movie it's very bad. That goes along with the first Spiderman. Both Spiderman movies suck!
__label__2 Very awesome<3: its full of action, adventure and some romance and though i dont like spiders, the spider man is kick ass<3
__label__1 Awful - Nearly Painful: I liked the first movie. It was generally Hollywood fluff, but was interesting enough that I could suspend my disbelief to the point I found it enjoying. An acquaintance of mine recently raved about the sequel and between that and the reviews here I was very anxious to see it when my colleague mentioned she had just bought it. Imagine my surprise when I caught myself watching the clock, rolling my eyes and eventually contemplating shutting off the machine during several points in the film.Kirsten Dunst lost whatever acting ability she had shortly after Interview with a Vampire. She doesn't seem to have the range or depth to portray the complexities of the relationship between M.J. and Parker. Macguire, I guess, plays a sadsack to a tee - but I don't think I've ever seen him play anything else.The one redeeming part of the entire movie is the fight scenes, while completely unbelievable - the effects are flawless.
__label__1 Not that Good: The first Spiderman was way better than this garbage. the acting was horrible and the action scenes... well there were hardly any action scenes. This movie sucked there was way too much talking. Doc Oc was horrible he wasn't even mean. don't waste your money.
__label__2 good, but the first was better: Spiderman was good, but I liked the first spiderman movie a lot more. This one was too much of Peter Parker not having his powers, and doing stupid stuff. For example, why did he keep on taking off his mask. The time on the train was understandable because spiderman could not see, but the rest of the times were just stupid choices for people to know spidermans identity. Also, why did spiderman keep on losing his powers. Shouldn't he still have his powers even if he didn't want to be spiderman. When Peter parker got bit by the spider in the first place, he didn't want powers, but he had them anyway. Now why is he losing them?The first one was better, but see this one anyway.
__label__2 Better than the first: Remarkably entertaining movie. I still get chills watching the action sequences on my 27" Television.
__label__2 Great price!: My daughter loves all the Spiderman movies and I bought her one through three for Christmas... can't beat the price!
__label__2 best hdmi player: best picture quality excellent sound and very good aesthetics .price is very low .easy to convert to all region
__label__2 Build Better Than Expected: Great product at great price (69.99 with free delivery). I recently purchased a panasonice upconverting dvd player and although the video, remote on that player is great the build quality is sub par compared to this player. glad to have this dvd player after having great experience with pioneer laser disc back in the day. usb input a huge plus. Great video. Don't hesitate.
__label__1 Would be great if I could watch it: Never mentioned in the description that this was a PAL video from another region than the USA. An omission that means a lot. I was at this show, have seen clips, and was looking forward to seeing the entire thing now, 11 years later. Be forwarned - if you get this and live in America and do not own a multi-region player you will be out of luck.
__label__2 Wilbur Smith at his best: I bought my first Wilbur Smith book Nov'86. It was translated to Swedish. At that time (being 22 years old) I hadn't yet started to read in english on a regular basis. Out of curiosity I counted the books from this author that I had bought over the years, and I found to my surprise that I had 19 different novels. I like all of them. If you purchase 'Birds of Prey' it is a good introduction to also buy other novels from the same author. Just a warning; dont pick it up and start to read unless you know that you have some time to spare. This book will not let you do other things for a while. All of his books are entertaining, highly interesting and yet educational at the same time. The perfect companion to bring when you want to have a quiet moment on your own and relax with a good book.
__label__2 Excellent reading, but not perfect: Well I have read most of Wilburs books (at least those on market for the past 10 years) and this is another good one, even though it seems that towards the end Wilbur just wanted to finnish the book quickly, the details of the first scenes are just not there towards the end. As I said it seems like he got bored and just wanted to finnish
__label__1 A trashy, macho bodice-ripper for guys.: When I started reading Birds of Prey, I really enjoyed the atmosphere and setting. Then I started groaning at the incredibly predictable behavior of the cardboard cutout characters. By 1/4 of the way through, I found myself hypnotized by the parade of every stereotypical character I remember from the trashy adventure books I loved when I was 12. The young, perfect hero. His loyal negro sidekick. The noble, tragic father. The backstabbing piratical villain. The fat, ugly, cowardly, corrupt, rich villain. The cruel villain who is, however, a "true warrior". The sultry temptress. The beautiful imprisoned princess. A half-dozen more plot elements which I won't reveal for fear of spoiling the book. In every way, at best an average book.
__label__2 Fundamentals of Management: Fundamentals of Management is a great book to get started in management. It covers everything that you would need to know. I like this book in particular because it has chapter tests at the end of every chapter so that you can kind of test yourself over what you had just did. I also liked how the definitions are out to the side of the reading as well as in bold in the reading. It makes it easy to find the words that you are looking for. I have learned a lot from this book. I went with some experience in managing and still learned something new every time I turned the page. I feel this is a great book to get started with in management.
__label__2 Well organized and easy to understand: My husband is using this book for his management class, so I'm giving you a second-hand review. I asked him how he liked the book, and the title of this review was his response. He's a man of few words, but the bottom line is that he finds the textbook very user-friendly, and it has benefited him a great deal in his class.
__label__2 So cute monogrammed!: The bedding I picked out did not have a diaper stacker...so this one went perfect. To tie it in with the bedding I got the top monogrammed. It looks so cute! Very pleased with it!
__label__2 Follett's Guide to Usage: As one who thinks it necessary to own every major English usage manual from Fowler on, I here state the firm opinion that Follett is the best of the reasonably contemporary examples and second only to Fowler. Follett is more erudite, more complete (not more comprehensive, I grant), and more analytical than the rest. (Yes, Bryan, this means you). For example, compare his treatment of the indefensible "in terms of" to any other.Someone speaks here of "disagreeing" with Follett's remarks on prescriptivism. Well, if you're not a prescriptivist then you oughtn't be reading usage manuals, and if you are one yet still disagree, you'd better find arguments more persuasive than his.Another critic says Follett isn't terribly useful as a quickhow-to guide. Well, true, but the genuine articles never are.
__label__2 If you like the classics, then why not?: I read previous reviews of this DVD set, and almost didn't buy it because of the negative reviews. I was basically getting it for free, so I figured I might as well.I understand where the others are coming from regarding the item being digitally remastered, but if you really enjoy the classics, then you'll love this DVD set. My wife & I have watched several of the cartoons, and they bring back great memories of when we were kids. I don't care that it's not digitally remastered. Would it be nice? Yes, but I wouldn't let that stop you from getting this set.
__label__1 No "Classics"... RIP OFF: I bought this expecting to get the classic xmas movies such as frosty the snowman and rudoff the rednose raindeer. I was VERY disappointed to find out neither were included. It has such movies as Frosty gets Married and Rudoffs 4th of July, all dumb movies made after the original just for money that aren't any good. It leads you to believe its a bunch of the classics but it is not. BEWARE, READ CAREFULLY WHAT YOU ARE GETTING!!!!
__label__1 get your money back: Big disappointment, not what is perceived to be by the picture on the box....DO NOT ORDER IT!
__label__2 Christmas Classics: This is a cute classic movie set and each disc has the main feature but then a another movie or two on it as well. I knew what I needed to order (I borrowed the box set but I broke one disc so I had to replace the whole thing). This was the cheapest place I found it. The set arrived very quickly. Thanks!
__label__2 Clasic Christmas Favorites: The grandkids loved this one. Not only did they get the favorites but the set included several the family had not seen!
__label__1 no little drummer boy 2: the trailer on this dvd set has advertisement for little drummer boy 2 but this dvd set does not have it instead you get pinnohios christmas dont know why warner did this but thats what is there
__label__2 ....And I'm Not a Stephen King FAN!!!!: While I don't relish in Horror pictures, something about the supernatural power of Good triumphing over Evil fascinates me. I have never been into KING. I do however love this movie and would watch it for years to come. It was scary, but not as gorry or as bloody as most. It was a great mystery that had you going until the very end. The best scene was the brother's return. I Cried!!! Not of Fright but of simple Emotion. IT IS A MUST SEE even if you are not into the KING!!!!
__label__2 Should become a comedy classic: This is Cyrano de Bergerac updated and told with the craziness of Steve Martin's brain--a wonderful, funny movie. Martin is the fire chief of a scenic Northwest resort town. There are two newcomers to town: a professional firefighter (Rick Rossovich) and a beautiful female astronomer (Daryl Hannah). Martin, the self-assured, passionate but ugly (that schnoz) chief and Rossovich, the dumb but handsome hunk both fall for Hannah; of course Hannah is interested in the hunk. But Rossovich is unable to talk to bright women, so Martin feeds him lines and Hannah is swept off her feet. The mistaken identity is all worked out satisfactorily by picture's end (Martin wins Hannah). Everything works perfectly in this movie, and Martin is at his very best. I've watched this quite a few times over the years and the humor never gets stale. A terrific movie.
__label__2 Charlie: He had very long nose, his buddies don't know what to do,or put out a fire if they found one. Her head is in the stars. Funny movie
__label__1 One good song: I like one song on this cd. "It's in the Rain" is a beautiful song. The rest sound like they were rushed to be completed in order to meet the release date.I have all of her other cds and I usually enjoy them, but this is the first one that I only like one song. Creatively, this one is missing something. She also looks silly on the cover.So far in 2005, the only artist to release a completely amazing cd is Madonna with "Confessions on a Dance Floor." Maybe Enya could call Madonna's producer. She needs a new sound. It's time to reinvent yourself, Enya!
__label__1 Predictable an uninspired.: Enya needs a change, or shes gonna end up like the new-age version of Madonna. Her fans who follow her blindly, will always give her good reviews. But this cd is Enyas worst. Not one song on this CD remotely began to move me inside. The whole CD is luke-warm while trying to be overly sentimental. (reminding me of Madonna once again). I could try to find a soung to recommend for download, but i cant even do that.Enya is slowing slipping into the void where once good artists who fail to change end up. Madonna, Enigma... and now Enya.
__label__1 A long wait for "Enh!" (yuk): Now, before you other Enya fans go into defense mode, I want to say I really like her stuff and have been a fan of hers for many years.That being said...This album is a bit of a letdown after such a long wait. (Okay, a lot of a letdown.) It's...well...boring. It lacks the intricate construction, memorable melodies and harmonies that earlier albums and tracks have. Take "To Go Beyond II": It has almost a fairytale, magical sound to it; "China Roses": It has beautiful harmonies and "softness" in it that delight the ears; "Long Boats" has a feeling of power and strength in it.Sadly, "Amarantine" has none of that.We all know Enya can do much better. Hopefully, in the not too distant future, she'll cut a new CD where her magic will return.
__label__2 You lose all cred ripping someone a new 'A' when you can't spell and make grammatical errors: I'm a little tired of hearing 'this is just the same as -blah blah- song/album and it's horrible/boring'. I love Ebadue and Africa i and ii, so I'm elated that 'the River Sings' has a similar feel. I think it's an amazing song and my favorite on the album. 'Amarantine' and 'Somebody Said Good-bye' remind me of the vocal songs from 'A Day Without Rain'. I never much cared for the songs with words before Wild Child, Lazy Days, etc, which are among my favorites from all of her works. 'Less than a Pearl' is hauntingly beautiful, and 'Semiregusa' is also very pretty.I've always enjoyed listening to any of Enya's albums to relax from a long day at work, for yoga and meditation; this album will definitely go into that mix. The above-mentioned songs will also go on my own 'Best of..' CD.
__label__2 A Soothing Voice In a Chaotic World: If there is one musical constant in a world of chaos it is the soothing voice and melodic songs of Enya. I love her and her music. Her voice, music and her very being are inexorably intertwined giving us a feeling of warmth and passion in our hearts that I can not find the words to describe. How can I describe exactly how lovingly she finds the beauty that is still in our world, a beauty that each of us carries inside like a piece of some great cosmic puzzle that only has to be realized. Perhaps long in coming but I love the wait and savor the moment and here is Amarantine. I truly love every track but there seems to be a special place for "It's in the Rain" for me. I have said what I have tried to put into words. I just love her music.
__label__2 Amarantine: More of the Good Same.: If you like Enya and you have them all, then by all means, get this album.Amarantine is beautiful. It's of the same timber as the rest of Enya's albums. [In honesty, if you find a bit of sameness troublesome then perhaps this album is not for you.]There are some variations. "The River Sings" has great Bounce. If I need to find a criticism then .... I felt that "It's In the Rain" was a little stilted. ...but only a little.I'll put all of Enya's CD's on shuffle play [that's 4 hours of music] and sit down, happy as a clam, with a good book. Amarantine is a good addition to Enya's discography....okay, I don't know what a clam would do with a good book, but I'm sure it would be happy.
__label__2 Whyte Weaves Wonders: A friend's Florida condo is as unlikely a setting to begin Whyte's Camulod Chronicles as one can imagine, but from the first page I was there, in the farthest reaches of the Roman Empire before the Fall. Now, with The Sorcerer: Metamorphosis, Whyte's weaved a magical, 3-dimensional tapestry of the birth of nations and Arthur's Britain from the failures of an Empire. The series is amazing and thank all that's good, a venue for a great mind! Thank you, Mr. Whyte.
__label__2 Worth Every Penny!: What can I say, the chapter on setting up your jointer is worth the price of the book by itself. The pictures and the diagrams are great, easy to understand, and the text is informative and easy to read. This book makes you a better woodworker, because your tools will be correctly set up, which also makes them more fun to use and much safer.I would recommend this book to you, even if you do not own the tool, but are looking at getting into woodworking, with this book you will be better able to understand how the various tools work, and you can buy decent used tools and tune them up, saving you a bundle!Great book!!
__label__1 This doesnt do rage credit: The Cd is a disgrace, I almost laughed out lad at the singers voice. If youre in need of a few laughs then buy this- if you like music by any rage album! This CD doesnt deserve a star. The music doesnt compare to rage at all.
__label__2 Looking Backward: I have a bad habit of diving into major events years after they occurred. I didn't understand Enron worth spit when it happened, and after reading this book(though the information is useless), I am conversant in the collapse, and picked up some insight about how stupid privately run utilities truly are. Nothing so essential should be left to crafty traders.
__label__1 boring, boring, boring: Some have called this book a "basic guide" for the Enron mess. I would call it a basic guide for falling asleep. I worked at Enron, and there is nothing more annoying than self-proclaimed experts trying to explain the ins-and-outs of a company from the outside. It's about as accurate and useful as a binder-ful of news clippings. This book fails to capture the spirit of Enron, and fails to capture the essence of what really went wrong. I hope some better books come along, because the quick-and-dirty paperback version here was a waste of time and money.
__label__2 Very Informative and Helpful: For anyone who searches to resolve the mysterious of stuttering, this is a must read. Bob has certainly discovered and reveals much of the mystery.
__label__1 Larry Garfield is compared to?: When Danny Devito's plays Larry Garfield he is like Taxi's Louie De Palma of Wall Street.
__label__2 Great speech by Larry at the end!: Not a bad movie -- not great, but better than average until the shareholder's meeting at the end. However, the speech that Larry the Liquidator (Danny DeVito) gives at the meeting is great! Larry explains -- very clearly -- why corporate takeovers are not a bad thing, and even why liquidation of an underperforming business is good. His speech ranks right up there with Francisco D'Anconia's speech in Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged.
__label__2 Love having a female hero: My two and a half year old does not watch much TV but she loves Jane and the Dragon on Saturdays (she also likes Jacob Two Two and we have ordered those books as well). She was very excited when she saw the books as well. In a time when TV execs could not allow Dora to be on top (by giving Diego his own show) it is nice to have a female lead that is strong and brave but also sometimes makes mistakes and learns from them.The stories are interesting enough for older kids too.
__label__2 Saw the TV show? Read the book.: If you have seen the wonderful Jane and the Dragon tv series you will enjoy the book. You hear the basic story in the theme song and wonder how Jane and her dragon met and what made the king let her train to be a knight. This book tells that story! It is an enjoyable story that engages everyone from children to adults. I highly recommend this book.
__label__2 Great transmitter but not universal: I ordered this expecting it to come with a 3.5mm connection but came with a different connection. Although it says designed for zune the pictures are misleading so if your looking for a universal transmitter make sure it is in fact universal. This transmitter is great rarely get static and its stereo so thats a plus!
__label__1 cant rate, don't work: I can't write a review because the DVD doesn't work when I put it in my DVD player. Terrible shame. Don't know why. Everything else works but this Frankie & Johnny DVD.
__label__1 Read carefully before you purchase from Amazon - see below comments: I was upset with this Amazon purchase because when I played the movie (Frankie & Johnny, Michele Pfeiffer & Al Pacino) it said ' this disc may not be played in your region 'well, little did I know that the movie I purchased was in Swedish. How could that happen? Can you tell me Amazon where I can purchase this movie in English. I don't need to review the movie because I have seen it before and loved it..that is why I wanted to purchase it..so I could watch it again and loan it to friends. It was not a big hit movie and it is very hard to find. It is a movie from the 1980's.Beware Amazon purchasers - read carefully before you purchase - read the fine print.Patricia
__label__2 It's good, not great. About right for the price.: This sharpener is good, not great, but probably right for the price. I sharpened a bunch of pencils in a row (we homeschool) and it ran smoothly about 90% of the time. There were a few clunky starts, nothing dramatic but not perfect. Also, and this is the reason for the lack of stars; the drawer is a bit of a pain. When you sharpen, of course there are shavings in the small drawer which is accessible right on the front, below the hole. Well, when you go to put the drawer back in, it's a tiny bit of a struggle. There is a small plastic `tube' or offshoot in the back of the drawer and you have to line it up with a hole inside the machine. Because the drawer is a rather cheap plastic, as is the tube/offshoot, I had the feeling it would break if I let my kids use it. Decent length cord, about as noisy as any X-Acto electric sharpener.
__label__1 Don't Waste Your Money: I bought this sharpener for my kids to use at home. We tried it a couple of times but it never sharpened a pencil evenly (wood all up one side so you can't write with it), it is really noisy, and vibrates a lot. It really feels like a bargain basement electric sharpener. I returned it and bought a Westcott iPoint Electric Pencil Sharpener which works so much better and is far less noisy.
__label__1 Doesn't work!: This sharpener did not work from the first time I attempted to use it. It only hummed when a pencil was inserted into the sharpener. It seems like the motor is bad or just too weak. I’m sending it back.I do NOT recomend this item.
__label__1 Disapointing: I ordered the Boston pencil sharpener and was sent the x-acto sharpener. I do not like it. My round pencils get stuck. The opening is not quite big enough. It is very noisy and it does not sharpen evenly. I sharpened three pencils and will return it. Very disapointing to get a different product than ordered.
__label__2 It works: All I needed was something to sharpen pencils with. We always get those cheap sharpeners that cost 50 cents at walmart.....no good. This is perfect.
__label__2 A reading escape: I want a novel that is well written. A book with story, plot, and characters that live and breathe. A book that for a few hours I can relax, lose myself, kick-back, and enjoy reading. Quiet Desperation is such a book and, for me, is the reason I love to read. I look forward to more advertures from Tuck Matson and more books from Mr. Smeraglia.
__label__2 A knockout ride of a thriller.: Jeff Fahey's life goes to hell when he receives an arm transplant after an auto accident. Turns out the arm came from a serial killer! Written and directed by genre favorite Eric Red, Body Parts is mostly superior entertainment from beginning to end. Fast-paced, with several exciting action sequences (The pseudo-car chase and hospital finale come to mind) and a decent mystery make certain the movie never lets up. Drags a few times in the beginning and the story gets maybe a little too silly, but this is overall a gripping horror/thriller. Fahey is superb, as is Brad Dourif as an eccentric painter.*** 1/2 out of *****
__label__2 theres a new sherriff in town!!: thses guys rock, and the vocals are 2nd to..well maybe dio ,well worth the price of addmission!
__label__2 Reference Quality Blu-Ray Picture: This picture transfer on Blu-Ray is definitely reference quality and worth bragging about and showing off to your Hi-Def junkie friends.I can't comment on the lossless audio quality since I cannot decode quite yet.This is a "must have" for any Blu-Ray collection.
__label__2 A movie that as it all!: Before I first watched "I, Robot" I was afraid it might have sold out as an action film. Thankfully I was wrong."I, Robot" contained an even balance of not only action, but psychology, sociolgy, philosophy, the clash of logic and emotions, life, and unconditional love. The movie made you think and feel with its knowledge, although its visuals and sounds were equally appealing with another nice balance of the present and the movie's version of the future. Such a natural feeling is rare in action films which helped the mind to agree that it is believable.If you watch this movie watch it not only for its action, but its beautiful philosophies. It can make anyone think. Or if you don't like to think, enjoy the action and seeing Will Smith naked in the shower (unless you don't swing that way). ;)
__label__2 A surprisingly good adaptation: Loosely based upon Isaac Asimov's story, Will Smith's I, Robot is good. I rarely have anything good to say about such adaptations but this detective story set in a future in which robots are commonplace is well-done and gripping. Although I think the key plotline of following "breadcrumbs," or deliberately set clues, could have been done better the special effects are for the most part impressive and believable. The acting was good and I was pleased to watch it.
__label__1 Not Asimov material: Smith has shown once again that he can only play one role - that of a disrespectful punk who grates on everyone's nerves. Asimov is probably rolling around in his grave right now. The special effects were good, but the acting was not. Chi McBride was great, and Bridget Moynihan did well, but Smith just reinforced the fact that he can't handle any role that doesn't exactly reflect his own personality and demeanor. I hope that some director in the future tries to cast Smith in a role that wasn't written for him - then we will all see that he really can't act his way out of a wet paper bag.Don't buy this on DVD - wait for it to come out on one of the cable movie channels...
__label__1 Oh, how stupid can they be?: Well, a lot. More than a lot. Poor Will does his best with a doggie script. He accounts for the one star.I don't know why those enlightened movie companies insist in making one SF dog after another. Did you watch the "The Chronicles of Riddick", "Sky Captain", or "AvP"? There are plenty of others around, all of them sucking money out of our pockets.They need to fool us in order to pay for the great CGI effects I suppose. They fail to understand that if CGI is used to generate profits, it will kill the emotional content of the movie. What's left is the customary Hollywood Pablum dulling our senses.Do not relate this dog to any of Isaac Asimov's works. They stole the title and we shall punish them by forgetting this miserable mutt.
__label__2 I, Robot: Loved this movie! Would have given it five stars if there had been a little romance thrown in. It was very good, even so.
__label__1 Review is specific for this combo pack more than the movie: I ordered the 3D/Bluray combo pack for the action/graphics. It's a typical Will Smith big budget action movie (so if you like those you'll like this).I don't post many reviews but I wanted to on this 3D/Bluray pack because the 3D disc does not play on my Vizio 3D Bluray player. The disc acts like it is going to load, and then just ejects. I ordered it a second time thinking that I had received a defective disc the first time. I was wrong. The second one did the exact same thing.Save your time and money and order a normal DVD.
__label__1 Not Even The Same Story As The Book!!!: The story is totally different than the book. All they took was the name and a couple of the characters.The story was pretty much a rip-off of the Terminator. Just think about it.(...) What is this thing next to the what, who did this and why?
__label__1 Ugh! What a travesty that this book was published!: Drag, drag, drag. I kept reading for two reasons: the first, I had nothing better to do one Sunday, and the second, I kept hoping something significant would happen. It didn't. This story had no climax, no capture, no passion. Who wants to read about the somber day to day lives of boring spinsters? (Of course I did, what a waste). Alice Hoffman is off my reading list. Her use of profanity was unwarranted and did not emphasize meaning in anything. Her characters were flat and the overall flow was slow if not stagnant. The ending was short and curt, as if she was just as bored writing it as it was to read. Unremarkable!
__label__2 Maybe 3 and 1/2 Stars: I picked this book up expecting to get lost in a magical world (maybe something like Harry Potter!) but this book failed to deliver on that front. The magic was underhanded and unorganized. However, with that said, this was still a good read. Examining the dynamics between two generations of sisters was interesting, and the writing moved along comfortably. Overall, it's worth reading, but don't expect to be mesmerized!
__label__2 terrific: The book was great! I have already recommended it to friends of mine. I would definitely read it again and again.
__label__2 A peppy lil guy that gets the job done!: HIGHS: suction, bare floor cleaning, retractable cord, quietness, ease of useLOWS: tips easily, not great for carpets, bag capacityVERDICT: A good little helper on hard surfaces but not ment for carpeted areas.
__label__1 For Those Who Like Intellectual Jibberish: If you liked high school poetry class, you might like this movie. Both my wife and I hated it because the teachers always seemed to find some meaning in a poem that completely mystified us. I thought this movie was going to be a search for the missing sixteen-year-old sister of the main character. If she found out what happened, it must have been hidden just like those esoteric 'meanings' our teachers found in the poems they assigned. I thought the movie was still setting the background when it suddenly ended. What it was all about, I have no idea.This is a movie for those who like to spout intellectual jibberish and think it means something. Or, maybe you have to be on some kind of illegal drug to make any sense of this movie?
__label__2 After all it is Poe: Great reading, year after year his works endure. Wish I had had the opportunity to meet him in person, no I'll haveto wait until the afterlife. Hope we both end up in the same place.
__label__2 Lullabies to paralyze: Well, as this album leads from songs for the deaf, i also have to say, this is a really good album. Long slow goodbye, little sister, and in my head are really good songs, and someone's in the wolf, (another song on the album) is good. and practically every song is pretty good. I would say the worst song(s) are broken box, and you got a killer scene there man. Well, let's see what our surprise is on the next album......
__label__1 Flummery: Surely, dear reader, this book must be a parody of Austen and Trollope. But one turns the pages with an uneasy consciousness that one has not been let in on the joke.
__label__2 Water Filter: This is exactly what was described and perfect! It fits right under the counter and is so easily installed. We searched forever to find a decent looking spout along with the water filter for under the sink and we finally found Aquasana!
__label__2 Best Steak Seasoning Ever: This is the best steak seasoning I've ever found in a store. I've established a great reputation for my steaks based on this seasoning. Unfortunately my local grocer stopped carrying it! I am worried I won't be able to find it any longer. It really is the best!!
__label__2 my mistake: I bought this to replace the 'fish' that my dog loved and we lost in the woods. I was excited about the 'turtle'. When it arrived it is tiny! My mistake as it clearly states it is for small dog. My 70# lab does love it still. I wish the 'turtle' came in a size for a large dog. Overall, it is a sturdy toy, my dog can break any squeaker but he does not destroy these, very strong/sturdy.
__label__2 Nice to share: I don't like to journal because of the big, blank page staring up at me. This is a great compromise because the space for gratitude isn't vast. My sister and sister-in-law were pleased to receive the journal as gifts, too.
__label__2 Great little journal: Received this as a Christmas gift from a dear friend, and I just love it. Keeps me in the moment and helps me remember all the wonderful things to be grateful for each day.
__label__2 This is great!: This journal allows you to highlight the good things in your life. It makes you think of the positive rather than the negative. It is a must-have!
__label__1 Excellent Adventure, but way Bogus Journey: This movie was nowhere near the original, so should you wish to watch it, don't expect to be in stitches the whole time. I honestly like it less and less each time I watch it, which to me is a mark of a bad movie. It does have it's moments, hence the 2 stars (it is after all Bill and Ted, it HAS to have moments!). My suggestion is rent/borrow it before purchasing it. If you love it--buy it. If not--don't.
__label__1 Bogus, package labeled correctly: Whole family loved the first when viewed in 2011, it is aging well. This one is not aging well too many things are too bogus to keep the story line going.The scene with the Reaper's Challenge is the only redeeming scene and even that one is slower than most scenes in today's comedies. Only watch if you are a "Bill and Ted" Historian.
__label__1 WORST FREAKING MOVIE EVER FREAKIING CREATED: although i do agree with all the reviews below mine, i would have to say this movie freaking sucked. It is the abomination of the movie world. It should have never been created, I got this in my cereal box, yep i was pouring my fruity lucks when this dvd popped into my cerial bowl. I tryed biting it to see if it was candy, but to no avail it was actually the dvd. I was so disappointed i decide to watch it, I thought i might get a good laugh out of how corny and cheesey... mmm. cheese... I want popcorn. THe movie actually scared me, and i had to go to the store to buy beer, and asprin. I then went to a party and talked about how bad this movie was. then i talked to alpha571 about it. I couldn't believe that there was a movie with russel crowe in it, where he wasn't yelling. Anyway, i liked the part in the movie where they died. that was the only funny part and they should have ended it there. good night everybody!
__label__2 Funny! Funny! Funny!: Bill & Ted are killed by "robot us-es". They were sent from the future to prevent the birth of "Wyld Stalions" Bill & Ted must now challenge death & escape the afterlife to set things right. Side splitting fun! Recommended!
__label__1 That Boy Mike Jones Is A Fake Man: That boy mike jones is about to get what is coming to him. He running around houston claiming he the king of the streets boy please. If anyone want to hear some real underground rap from houston go get that Chamillionaire (The MixTape Messiah) cause that is a true mc that should be out there cus Dike Jones -Who- Dike Jones his album is never coming soon. He has been saying that it is coming soon since 2002 but all he has done is put out two trash cds before he would even put out the cd he been talking about for two years. now he about to put out a cd with Paul Wall Called -The Future- but where in the hell is His Solo album. Oh Yeah it coming soon since 2002. Paul Wall messed when he turned his back on Chamillionaire but That Mixtape Messiah pt.2 expose this fraud ni--as. So go get that Chamillionaire The Mixtape Messiah. SO you can remember what real underground music is. Hiram Clarke Tx.
__label__1 Way Too Small For Anything but the Camera: If you bought a camera and you want somewhere to keep all your "stuff" - nothing outrageous but things like cords, a couple of CDs, maybe a wireless mic, this is NOT your bag. It will carry only your camera. No extra stuff. Buy this to carry your "stuff" and you will still be relegated to carrying the rest of your items around in a plastic grocery sack.
__label__1 Did not live up to expectations: Getting the book, I thought it 'would change my life' through all the insight Sennett would bestow on me. Sadly not the case, it was a lackluster title. I don't really have any suggestions as to what might be better.
__label__1 Long and allegorical: Too long.May sound good if you don't know your Bible or Biblical History.The world won't end on 2011 either.
__label__2 Any Fan will be happy.: I did have some concern from other reviews that mentioned the lackluster sound quality. I am very picky about my sound. But the price made me do it and I am happy I did. This CD had all the songs I needed to fill out my collection. The quality was not an issue at all. This is well worth the money, you will not be disappointed. This is a perfect addition to that EWF fan that wanted to grab a few songs on ITUNES, you can get this CD have everything you needed and more for the cost of a few songs on Itunes.
__label__2 what's up w/ Jarrett: This is a great album of atmospheric, moody music. Gary's bass sounds great and he plays well throughout. Jack accents the mood and only really opens up on the last two tracks. I would consider this one of my all time favorites if not for one thing: Keith Jarrett moaning and whining. I can't understand it. His playing is so beautiful and lyrical, all overlaped w/ these strange and annoying noises. I know it is an expression of emotion while playing, but I find it highly destracting. This album, though, is good enough to look past it. Barely.
__label__2 Nice supplement to study Meisner work.: Nice explanations as to why you learn the words in the way that you do and all books in this series include notebook client pages for you to take notes or practice the exercises. I liked the fact that he included questions of the class and his answers to those questions.
__label__2 A way to understand the language of film.: As a college film instructor, I find Persona a wonderful text for students to begin to understand the ways film language operates. With it, the critical viewer can surpass content-based approaches to film and begin to understand the way film communicates visually. Not only do I find the film valuable for my students, but myself as well. I love to watch it and unravel its complex and compelling messages. In approaching such a bold and innovative work, I find much of what I love in movies. That experience is beautiful. Persona is one of the few films which can do that for me as well as it does.
__label__1 Nope, not worth it: Rated at 1000mAh, just like the original Panasonic battery for my TZ5. Only had 1/2 the life at first. A little over a year later, it only lasted for 4-8 picture and 3-5 minutes' worth of video. After a year and a half, this battery is dead. Not even recommended as a backup. Spend the extra few dollars and get one with a better user rating, more mAh, or better yet, just get the Panasonic.*Update: I returned it under their 3 year warranty (though they now say it's only 2). I had to pay $2 to ship it back to them (which is fine), and now they say I owe them another $7.50 for shipping and handling. Wow, this battery only costs $7.14 new right now.**Update #2: I ignored their request for another $7.50, but after a month or so, they sent me a new one anyway (which has been sitting in my desk ever since, since I bought a higher quality backup battery in the meantime...the Kinamax 1300mAh S007 for about 15 bucks).
__label__2 Siempre hay que tener 2 baterías: Les recomiendo que siempre tengan 2 baterías, la original con la que viene la cámara, en mi caso la Panasonic Lumix DMC-TZ5K, y otra de reemplazo para que nunca se pierdan ningún momento por tener la batería descargada. Carga perfectamente en el cargador original de la cámara y su precio es muy muy bajo... comparen y verán.
__label__2 Works Great: Most Panasonic cameras have a pretty good battery life. Unless you shoot a lot of pictures, or use the flash a lot. In that case, you will need another battery and this is a good choice.
__label__1 bleh: well, they don't taste like anything... and they're really hard to bite into - not crispy, just really hard. If you're a sailor from the eighteenth to ninteenth century and you're used to "ship's biscuit", then I'm sure you will love these as they've got more protein and better taste, and are also in nice sealed packages (no weavils!) They remind me of Woody Allen's line, "I could make a lot of money selling these in a health food store."I went for these because of all the rave reviews, and I am now dissapointed. I guess I can feed these to my boyfriend... he might eat them if he's really hungry and there's nothing else.
__label__2 Nice album for the sad times: Hefner is really awesome. If you listen "Love will destroy us in the end" you may find the most sensitive, yet funny, song of the album and it's quite surprising that a band can do that without using epic arrangements with horns and all that stuff. I recommend this album because no one has this one and i'd love to talk about it with anyone.
__label__1 DO NOT BUY THIS EDITION: PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS EDITION! IT IS POORLY EDITED AND FULL OF TYPOS AND ERRORS. GET THE PENGUIN EDITION INSTEAD.
__label__1 Good movie, terrible DVD: I have no problems with the movie. But technically, the quality of this disc is beyond terrible. It looks like a YouTube video does when you play it on a 50-inch plasma. Only worse -- compression artifacts, tiling with squares the size of Post-it Notes, banding that looks like 16-bit grayscale. It made the whole thing unwatchable for me. [...]
__label__1 DEFECTIVE PRODUCT: I ordered and had to return two separate copies of this DVD because of wavy lines in the picture on both copies.
__label__2 Detour: Made by a Poverty Row studio in just six days, this cynical, acid-tongued noir exemplified what a skilled director like Ulmer could do on a shoestring budget. Narrated by Neal, whose weary voice is that of a man recounting a terrible nightmare, "Detour" wallows in grim fatalism and sports a wildly venomous turn by Savage, as the castrating vixen who blackmails Al into a seedy get-rich scheme. Crisp pacing, rabid dialogue, and on-the-fly camerawork make this disturbing and fascinating "Detour" well worth taking.
__label__2 Great book: Wonderful book if you want to know more about the practices of the samurai. I bought this for my boyfriend and he found it very useful.
__label__2 Path to integrity: This work is from the memoirs of an enlightened soul . written some 600 years ago, still applies to every day life in the 21st century. Better than any "self help" book on the market. It's a self help guide, to peace - integrity - and enlightenment of our soul . Seen through eyes of a free spirit, indentured to service. living by a code
__label__2 Insight into the spiritual ideals of the Samurai: The translation may be a little enigmatic at times, but the core of the material is extraordinary. As a historical document, it reflects on the ideals that defined the Samurai spirit, and laments the loss of this selfless nature.
__label__2 Love This Mat: This mat is perfect for me. The 10mm thickness provides the cushion that I need for my ankles, back, and knees. I also love that it is decomposable, recyclable, does not absorb moisture, is toxic-free, hypoallergenic, and wipes clean with a mild solution of soap and water. Very much worth the price.
__label__2 Best Value for the $$$: Easy to put together. Came with very good and clearcut instructions.You have to have a good amount of floor space for it to turn though.Other than that it is a super buy!!!
__label__1 One-Sided and incomplete: One can go on forever about who is pro this or pro that, but the truth is that the most complete and recognized book on the subject of the Liberty is written by Jay Cristol, a United States Judge who has devoted his life to the FACTS of what went on that day. This book shows one side, from an emotional person who was hurt and angry. If you read this book, you do yourself and history a disservice if you do not read Jay Cristol's book as well. I was "horrified" by the incident, as any American would be, until I read the explanations and facts addressed by Judge Cristol. Seemingly impossible facts to refute, mentioned in this book, have complicated but indisputable answers. A country fighting for its life does not brutally attack its ONLY ally in the world. There are answers, and this book does not have them. Judge Cristol's book does.
__label__2 I bought it by mistake.: First, let me say that I ordered this movie by mistake.I wanted to order more movies but I got this instead.How are you supposed to get the movies you want?Now I have the movie I want so I watch it. It is called theWorld's nuttiest nutcracker. Which is why I bought this moviebecause it's about world records for who is the nuttiest of all.Let me repeat that I hate cchristmass. But I love movies about christmass. I dont have to deal with my own family because I hate them. So now I watch this movie and I like it like 4 stars out of 5, it is insane. There are all these people in the moviethat look like cheap plastic, but wait they are not real, they are realtime 3d people/fruit. So that caught my Eye and I loved the fact that this was a good choice to buy and then watch thisawfull film
__label__1 Not So Great...: I purchased this video in a bookstore on Cape Cod last summer and was disapointed. Though I admit no video or photograph can match the beauty of the Cape that I know, this video is both dated and technically rough around the edges. The content was a little superficial as well.Sorry, if this sounds superficial, but hopefully they'll update it.
__label__2 Touching tale of committment and love.: A young boy opts to adopt an abused and neglected dog in need of a home rather than raise a coveted purebreed pup and learns that hard-earned love is sometimes the sweetest to receive. Ukrainian artist Katya Krenina's illustrations are delightful and Lisa McCourt's tale of a boy and his dog seemed particularly relevant to our family's own adoption story.
__label__2 On time and new as described: Reasonably priced and shipped on schedule. Valves and membranes were new and in packaging as described. Pricing is very competitive and purchasing was easy.
__label__1 no accolades here: I threw this book in the trash, I was so very disappointed. Characters are flat, story lines are absurd........why would I be interested in a stepmother sleeping with her stepson after the funeral of her husband? All of you who seem to love this author, switch to Elizabeth Berg.....superior author and stories with depth.
__label__2 Unique Subject Matter: "Come to Me" is a book of short stories. Each one dealing with outrageous, extraodinary, unimaginable subject matter.Such as..."Love is not a Pie" about a husband and wife who bring another man into their bed.OR..."Sleepwalking" A stepmother seduces her stepson. (Naughty)"Silver Water"... A tearjerker about a girl remembering her sister'slife and suicide."Only You"...A bored housewife who falls head over heals with her hairdresser who happens to be a transvestite.My favorite---"Phychoanalysis Changed My Life"...A (very smart) therapist has a plan to set her son up with a patient. (unexpected and colorful)!If you're seaching for skillful writing, unique metaphor, truth, and the element of uncut surprise...this is definitely the book for you.>>NOTE>> Even though I did not agree with some of the subject matter, I found myself identifying with the characters.
__label__1 Poor: A very poor book. Don't bother. From the title, you'd think the book has interesting information from high-level commanders. It doesn't. It's mostly just a bunch of ramblings, often contradictory. The chapter on Finland maybe would rate three stars. I think the only useful information in the whole book otherwise was the information on the number of snow-plows per mile that were needed to keep roads clear. If you are looking for any other logistical info, forget it. The description of the book is highly misleading, and I regret having bought it.
__label__1 Neither Savage or Sensuous: I must admit that the title caught my attention. Sad to say the music won't. It reminded me of being in a department store elevator stuck in the mezzanine and unable to get out. You can save yourself. If you want good exotica buy a Les Baxter CD.
__label__1 Greek: This was not a very good movie, nor well acted. Anthony Quinn always play good movies but this one was just o.k.
__label__2 Great book, great information, great photographer!: I think that Ansel Adams was a great photographer, I personally love photography, and would love to see more professional photographers.
__label__2 A Good Resource Book: Grasping God's Word makes an excellent resource book for any personal library. It is written in such a way that readers on several levels of education may find it informative and useful. A strong emphasis on application of Scripture is much appreciated.
__label__1 College book: Thank you for sending the book fast so that I could start reading it for my college class
__label__2 Run a full size smaller - but toasty warm: I have several other pairs of slippers for winter, and these are my absolute favorite. they're so warm and comfortable. My only two complaints though are that I'd like to see a more supportive footbed. Also, they do run a full size too small, so be sure to order one size up. I did so at the recommendation of the other reviewers, and they were right. The sole of the slipper is also non-slip.
__label__1 do not order these: I received mine yesterday and returned them today. The uppers are glued to the sole in a haphazard fashion. Once you put them on, you can feel the edges where the uppers are glued and clipped on the inside. I doubt they would last long. Glue is not the way to go. They should be stitched. Shoddy workmanship all the way around. I am sorry I paid for the shipping to get them. and the shipping to send them back. All in all, $16 to find out they were shoddy. Never again!
__label__2 Warm but less than perfect: Shearling is the best slipper material I have ever tried, so I've owned a number of shearling slippers. The sole of these is not as cushy as others I've had, and they don't feel quite as snug (which makes slippers snuggly). Having a non-shearling outer sole, as these do, is key for any sort of durability. Not a bad buy at the price, but there's a little compromise.
__label__2 Good Christmas Present: My wife asked for slippers to replace some old, warn ones I'd given her years before At that point the mall was beyond crowded, so I went online. After browsing for what seemed a LONG time (I'm a guy, I hate to shop), I found several, and finally narrowed it down to this. She loves them! And for a "color challenged" guy, I even picked the right color. They are great!
__label__1 Almost a whole size too small: I bought these last year and tried them on - too small, but I thought perhaps they'd stretch out a bit. WRONG! I've been wearing them now - still almost new - for a month now w/ no luck on any stretching. My toes are smushed all the way to the end and they hurt! I even have a narrow foot, for what it's worth - not that the width would affect much. Still - bummer..
__label__2 Great for the price.: I bought these when they were deal of the day for around $15. Can't complain about a deal like that. In response to the reviewers who said to order a size up I'd say maybe order up a half size if you like your slippers fairly loose. When I first got mine I thought they would be too small but after wearing them a couple of days they stretch out and I think they run pretty tru to size. I wouldn't pay $50 for them but if I see them for deal of the day again I'll be buying them for all my family.
__label__2 Fixed more than Our Table Issues (no doubt!): We brought this baby home, expecting the most. Boy, did we get it. It was one of those nights: Clarance and Arnold are "on their way", six others were expected. I had an amazing recipe from Marie Curie (Spanish salad!) and Ken had squeezed the juice clean from the cranberry. We threw the table together, and after some simple instructions (and not less than two stubbed thumbs) we were in "biz"! I would decide to tell anyone that this tool really has something for everyone. Pleased customer.
__label__2 Widge: I like this product when using my Bosch combo kit on my router table. This base allows me to adjust the router bit height from above the router table by using the included Hex Key. In additon, I can leave this base permanently attached to the router table. I simply pull the motor out of the base that's attached to the router table and then stick it into one of the other router bases when I want to use the router freehand. Very convenient.
__label__1 Bad product.: This product really sticks. I bought a couple days ago and then had to return it. I couldn't even set up the VNP because there was no proper documentation. I call Netgear and their support was no help at all. The router couldn't work wirelessly and wired simultaneously for the same machine... without reset the router... What I am trying to say is if you connected wirelessly to the router and then disconnected that wireless connection and then plugged into the router with your wired LAN cable... you would not have a connection. Unless you went into the the router wirelessly and resetted it manaully. The latest firmware upgrade they have for the router is a beta v1.2 - And if you have a a problem with beta versions of their firmware you cannot call them (Netgear).... you have to email .... beta@netgear.com or something like that. It does have alot of cool features but there are too many glitches. Hope this review helps.
__label__1 decent products - awful technical support: I've had a variety of netgear products over the last 3-4 years. I've generally been pleased w/features and functionality.Up until recently I've never had to draw on netgear tech support. However, after a year of working fine one of my firewall/routers went "kerplunk." All the signs point to a hardware problem. So I contacted tech support realizing that I'd have to go through the usual rigamorole (sp?) to get an RMA.However, despite a very detailed email description of the problems and the various things I did to try and fix them (firmware upgrades/reinstalls, hardware resets, etc) the tech who answered me told me I'd have to contact them through telephone support.Currently (11:10 PM Eastern Time, 29 July 2003) wait times for tech support are in excess of 140 minutes! That's unacceptable.If you are lucky enough to never need tech support, or to have an item repaired/replaced then netgear is a fine option. Otherwise, buyer beware!
__label__1 Waste of Time.: Viewed: 7/11Rate: 27/11: Zzzzz...watching The Addams Family is like pouring nitric acid on my brain. I hate all of the characters, and it gets ever annoying to watch Gomez to be fancy and exciting doing things. It's like...Can the nightmare end? Even though it is a 101 minute flick, The Addams Family is just too long to sit through. The plot is idiotic, and the whole time, I am wondering why couldn't they have electrocuted Fester in hopes of kicking his amnesia over. I am surprised that, despite the fact that everybody in the family likes dark incidents and so so, nobody was abusing drugs. Wake me up when somebody hires Thing for a job...like he has a social security number. Did the film really start the gothic trend where stupid kids in high school were dressing up all in black and pretending to have mental and emotional problems? All in all, The Addams Family is a terrible piece of rubbish that manages to make time to crawl very slowly.
__label__2 Great look at the feastival!: I thought this was a great book - especially for someone just learning about this like me. The writing is easy to get into (in some cases a bit too cutsy I'm afraid but I looked past that). I enjoyed the section on the history of halloween across cultures although in some ways it seemed like too much of a high level synopsis but it was an ok introduction. The section on halloween symbols was excellent since we see all these things typically at halloween (black cats, witch hats etc). There are some fun divinations which include runes. And there are of course blessings and recipes etc. I think this would be a great family book - to give kids (all of us really) a bit more meaning to the day rather than just getting a stash of candy from the neighbors. Definitely a great introduction and fun stuff to do. I'm giving it 4 stars rather than 5 since I was expecting a bit more substance but its fun nonetheless.
__label__2 Loved This Book!: Really opened my eyes on the myths,misconceptions and superstitions.Silver made me smile more than once. I plan on reading it again.VERY informative. Also recommended reading is Silver's To Stir A Magick Cauldron and To Ride A Silver Broomstick. Check out author Yasmine Galenorn also!
__label__2 Box Of Hair: I heard that Cub broke up. If it's true it's truly tragic. Cub are a female trio from the Great White North who specialize in sugary-sweet pop gems with a very little bit of a country feel. Sometimes they remind me of The Fastbacks. They play clean with little or no distortion & make good use of light-hearted humor. The Last 2 tracks "Riverside" & "Not What You Think (Live)" show that they can do much more than the seemingly empty cutsie pop songs. Their pop songs, however, are not as vacuous as they may appear to be on the surface. They are smart, creative & heart warming. I don't know if this is Cub's best album, because they are all so good, but I do know that if bands like Heavenly, Go Sailor & Butterglory make you happy, then so will Cub.
__label__1 Poor performance: This brand was my 2nd Delonghi thermal carafe model in 2 months, after the first one broke after 5 weeks. This one worked wonderfully for about 4 weeks until one morning. I came in and found coffee all over the counter. I thought I had not aligned the pot properly or something. After another week of dealing with this, the electrical system shorted out due to all the coffee spills. This coffee maker made the best coffee and the carafe kept it hot all day. I don't know what happened and we couldn't get it resolved. We purchased a Cuisinart with a 3 yr warranty (not the one that grinds coffee) and has worked great for 6 weeks.
__label__1 Terrible packaging: The kit came in one of those treacherous plastic molded shells designed to hang on a store display. It took almost 10 minutes and several bloody fingers to access the contents. Of course the picture on the Amazon website does not show this egregious over-packaging.
__label__1 Stupid Amazon Return Policy: Amazon won't take back the item, even if it is UNOPENED. Even if I pay for return shipment. What a second rate retailer...
__label__1 LWatLA: If you had a rating of -100 it would be rated below that. The case is solid but has no on & off switch. The soft ware program is rip rip rip off. no customer service. Still have not heard back from them.I would not advise my worst enemy to buy this product. It was awast of time, money & efor. do not,do not buy this product.
__label__1 Dell 700/710m laptop owner beware: This product makes a copy of the new disk from old disk. But it is not bootable using the EZ GIG 2 software. I have Dell Media Experiance but not Dell Media direct. After trying for two weeks and researching I got hold of tech support, really. Waited on hold for 45 min. After talking with them. I was told it does not work for the dell 700/710m laptops. So now instead of using my new 120GB drive to replace my 80 GB drive. I have another 120GB external drive. But it does have all my files and programs.Sadly it was a waste of money.
__label__1 Alan Moore's writing for comics: I wanted more of a "how to book" on comic writing, concerning breaking in, making contacts, etc. Too much drawing plot comparisons and witty talk. It's a small enough book to skim through and I didn't find what I was looking for. Maybe it helps out the aleady established comic writer? But for those of us who have yet to make it. Nah.
__label__2 How to create comics from the man who changed them.: Alan Moore's work is among the most influential in the comics field. This essay, which is bound in a comic-style format, is short but gets the creative juices going. He shares some useful insight into storycraft and framing plots for the comics medium. I do not write comics (prose fiction is my area), but I dound this insightful and inspiring. If you like his work in Watchmen and Swamp Thing, this is definitely worth picking up. And it is very, very cheap.
__label__2 love this book: I love this book for reference on the job. It has tons of diseases and has a great format. I used the full version in nursing school so I found it easy to navigate when i started to practive. It also comes with a code so you can download the book to your PDA.
__label__2 My Great Aunt Arizona: This is a wonderful book. As an elementary teacher I especially enjoy reading it with my students and own a classroom set. It is a beautiful story of a teacher and contains lovely illustrations. It is a sweet depiction of schools and life long ago.
__label__2 Great, so where is it now?: If you like Seal and his passionate, powerful voice then this abreviated release is a must have. Stripped of all the production effects these raw versions of some of Seal's best songs show Seal for the artist he is and they really highlight the emotional power of his voice. The huge problem is you can't find this release anywhere anymore. That's a true disservice to Seal and his fans.
__label__1 Title is misleading!!!!: You would think that a DVD with an alluring girl on the cover and had the word "SEX" in the title would well, have SEX in the actual movie. But, you'd be completely wrong if you bought Phone Sex Fantasies because there is NO sex, real or simulated in the entire DVD! Basically, the girls talk dirty (sorta) and then take off their clothes. That's it.
__label__2 Olivia, the vocalist: While promoting this album in 1989, Olivia appeared on a TV show with Dionne Warwick. During the show, Dionne said how Olivia's voice could be defined : clear as crystal. And that's exactly what this CD showcases : Olivia Newton-John's crystal clear voice.Hitting wonderful high notes in such a soft way, Olivia delivers standards such as "Over the rainbow" or "Reach out for me" with that special quality that makes her so unique. My favorite tracks on this are, by far, "You'll never walk alone" and "When you wish upon a star" - these always give me goosebumps...Originally intended for her then 3 year old daughter, this CD is a perfect gift for moms-to-be, or just simply a wonderful gift, either for yourself or for someone else...
__label__1 Just plane bad cap.: When I received this cap I thought I was getting a letter. The cap was crammed into a flat envelope. Terrible quality,very flimsy brim. Awful item. I don't know where the positive reviews came from. This is a cap I will NEVER wear. In fact it went from the envelope it came from straight into the trash where it belongs. Very bad buying experience would not ever buy from this seller again. This is NOT a military cap. It's a crap cap made in China.
__label__1 Best Data 56K USB Modem Macintosh: As other reveiwers noted this modem cannot stay connected. You can reestablish connection by unplugging and plugging the USB but this is a pain. Instructions that come with modem are incomplete and do not give information about lights. Also Best Data tech support does not respond. There are bound to be better choices.
__label__1 Not worth the title 'junk': I purchased this device at my local Frys on an employee recommendation and also based on details on the box. I could not get my g4 1.25 dual to see the modem in spite of everything I tried. The tech support would not respond, the website has no mac drivers, my mac wouldnt recognize it as a USB device and the included instructions and the CD have no drivers or details that would be helpful. After a frustrating few weeks I gave up and returned this. The only thing it did properly was power on when connected to a usb port. Pathetic.
__label__2 James Last Tango: This is a fantastic CD, and again, one of my favourties. I can remember hearing tracks from this in the early 1980's, and thinking how great they were. I ordered a "used" one from Amazon, and it plays perfectly. If you like Tango music, then I think you will enjoy this.
__label__2 The day the world came to town: Having recently watched a "Made for TV" movie based on the true events contained in this book I was anxious to read the facts about the way the good folk of Gander, Newfoundland rallied round & accomodated, fed & entertained an influx of 6,600 air travellers aboard 39 planes which had been diverted to their town due to American airspace being shut down on 9/11.I was not disappointed !Jim Defede, the writer, presents a very well written account of the 4 days that the world came to Gander & chronicals both the huge logistical operation and the emotional experiences for both passengers and townsfolk.Many friendships were formed over those 4 days which exist to the present day, and I cannott commend the town of Gander enough for the humble, caring way they held out the hand of genuine friendship to complete strangers.This is a " must read" book.
__label__2 A different look at 9/11: I really enjoyed this book. It gives you a different perspective on Sept. 11th. We have read so many stories of the people who perished on that day and this story talks about those people who were totally inconvenienced by the events. It is so interesting to hear their stories and how this little town welcomed these people from all over the world. Many of the stories are very heartwarming and also sad. Once you get started it is a hard book to put down. Highly recommended for anyone who has more interest in reading about 9/11.
__label__2 They work!: I have tried every ice pack on the market! The ace ones are great, but every single one leak! No matter how careful I am with them.....they leak at the seams. These are less expensive and with proper care last forever! When using them cold, you do need a cover of some sort........an old pillow case works well folded over several times. Plus the size works well. Big enough to sit on your head for those migraines without falling off easily. Sometimes holding your head still to keep the ice pack on ends up hurting your neck, which makes your head worse. Defeats the purpose. For the money, this one is a good choice!
__label__2 My 2 year old literally took his breath away he was so excited!!: WHAT A TOY!! Better than the Thomas table, this thing is solid! SO nice, it comes with all the people and vehicles and trees and fire departments, etc. I am overwhelmed. My 2 year old loves it and has not stopped playing with it! Thanks!!!!
__label__2 Mom of twins equals needs something durable!: My son is 2 1/2 and spends hours a day playing with his table. Wonderful purchase! Only negatives is that one leg was cracked during shipping and the other is my little boy is too busy playing for me now!
__label__1 fair towards midland: This book is typical of its genre. It relies heavily on Snorre Sturlusson's "Prose Edda", which is one of the clearest sources on Nordic Mythology, it must also be kept in mind that Snorre was writing several hundred years post Heathen and was also highly influenced by classical forms of Mythological models. In short, Snorre's work reads like Greek myth with Nordic characters. Not to mention that he was not writing a handbook on Heathen belief, he was writing a handbook on poetry, particularly skaldic metric form and added the myth parts for reference. Snorre's work is useful as a secondary reference at best, and if Snorre got it wrong, and a book (this one) is based on Snorres works.... well... you get the picture.
__label__1 This light absolutely sucks: Don't waste time or money on this garbage - you can't mount it, and the replacement battery is very expensive. Useless!
__label__1 Book Critic2: I was a little dissapointed with this purchase because it claims to be hardcover but in actuality it is three ring punched and individual pages. It is complete and in very good condition though. I would still consider purchasing from this agent since the prices are very low.
__label__2 And most important, my wife likes it....: I was not sure if I wanted a rocker or a fixed recliner for my outdoor porch. I came across this glider by accident and at first dismissed it. I remember as a kid seeing gliders made of metal with springs that groaned and made up of fused together rust. After reading other reviews and taking a chance, I bought it. It went together easily enough except for one locking bolt that did not line up. I had read another reviewers suggestion that I keep a drill handy, and with that and a little persuasion, it came together fine. Even though the wood was treated at the factory, I live in Florida where everything gets old before it's time,so I gave it a treatment with teak oil. It looks great, feels solid and is very comfortable. Great buy for the price.
__label__1 A word of warning to "jazz" fans: This album has British saxophonist Courtney Pine really coasting - smooth & mellow with a predominance of synthesisers & drum programming with no real "blowing" or hard edges. Very, very reminiscent of Kenny G with some synthesised reggae inflections & also some rather schmaltzy vocal work. If you like that sort of thing, fine, but in my humble opinion "smooth" jazz like this just isn't worth the time or money, given the abundance of truly high quality, inventive jazz available.
__label__2 X-Pulse: Get your heatbeat pounding with the newest expansion to the popular MechWarrior 4 Vengeance!With the addition of new Mechs, like the Sunder, Wolfhound, Uller and More, you will be able to trade on the black market for new weapons and mech chassis.I highly recommend this game, as a sysop with the Microsoft Gaming Zone!!! Play it online with up to 15 other people for the ultimate players experience....
__label__1 Newbie: I didn't get to review the book I was looking for before I got sent to sign up as a new customer to Amazon. I don't know how to get back to the info on the book from this link to review it before rating it. Sorry.
__label__1 Ow!: These shoes look cute and got good review, so I decided to give them a try. Even though I ordered a half-size larger than I normally wear, they hurt so much when I tried them on that I never even wore them out of the house. I returned them and am planning to buy a pair of Dansko wedges.I should mention that I have very attractive feet - big, flat, and square (like Fred Flintstone) - that only respond well to orthopedic-looking shoes. If your feet are of a daintier variety, these might be fine.
__label__1 Print version has no industry information like the older version. Not worth subscribing if you are in the industry.: Years ago, the Hollywood Reporter print subscription had everything any pro or aspiring pro in the movie business needed to know. The current print version is more for movie fans than the industry trade it used to be. You must subscribe to the digital online version to get the industry information instead of the print version now.
__label__1 WHY....GOD WHY???: I can't believe that this song came on the top of the list and his great "Original Sin" single from 2002 didn't even reach top 20. This song isn't disaster, but it is one of his weakest and it isn't even Elton's composition. If you wanna this song, buy then "Complete Thom Bell Sessions" album. There is also "Three way Love Affair" on it.This is sweet repetitive disco song with too much sugar on it. Not disaster, but certanly not one of his best at all.
__label__1 DO Not Buy, Do Not Buy: I read a lot of negative reviews about the purchase of high end, expensive perfumes at Amazon Website; however, since this one was being sold by amazon.com itself, I decided to take a risk. I am extremely disappointed with this purchase. The fragrance is so subtle that even a person standing one foot away cannot appreciate it------------and that is immediately after putting it on! Complete waste of money.
__label__2 Steve Au: This pacifier was the best part of my son's Halloween costume. We got so many compliments on it. It is so much easier than putting a baby in a goofy costume they don't want to be in.
__label__2 last recordng by the best sax player of his generation: The best sax player of his generation joined by one of the best pianists ever. This is Getz last recording, and some of his solos are almost unbearably sad. His lyrical inventiveness was never greater though. Getz doesn't embellish the original melody in his solos. He makes comletely new ones of even greater beauty. Here they are often plaintive and full of pain. Jazz artists rarely display this sort of emotional openess. But Getz's technnical skills and Romantic imagination turn all this into high art. Barron, of course, is simply the best jazz pianist around. Together they have produced a truly great album.
__label__2 Love it.: I got this as a used product and got a good deal for it.The movie plays as good as new. I like the whimsicalnature of this movie.
__label__1 unbalanced: This is an unbalanced view of the so-called AIDS epidemic in South Africa. Thabo Mbeki put his reputation on the line to challenge the AIDS orthodoxy. For his reactionary intransigence he is marked with pejorative epithets like denialist. He is vilified and demonized. He refuses to accept that the health of South Africans is declining because of their sexual behaviour, not poverty and underdevelopment. He opposes pushing toxic drugs on pregnant woman and their babies. This honest and hard working leader deserves recognition. There are fair and balanced books on the South African AIDS epidemic, this book is not among them.Errare humanum est sed diabolicum perseverare....
__label__2 These are gorgeous!: I would expect to pay 6 times more for these lovely earrings in a boutique shop!I have received compliments on them everytime I've worn them!Beautiful!
__label__1 Disappointing: The text of this book is some eighty pages, which appear to be a very bare-bones summary of various theories of learning, often with charts inserted from other books, with very few examples or guidelines as to how one would actually implement any of those ideas. You really just get an academic summary of these ideas with virtually no context or elaboration. I would recommend you rather go directly to the work of the Israeli educationalist Feuerstein (see the book by Sharron and Coulter, Changing Children's Minds), and that of Stanley Greenspan (numerous books), which seem to be the key works reflected in this all-too-brief book
__label__1 Too Small: This brooch is far too small and expensive for its size. I was shocked when I pulled it out of its pouch. May I iterate, it is far too small. Without a moment's hesitation this brooch was immediately returned.
__label__2 Great price fast shipping: I odered standard shipping on sunday and they got here on wednessday great deal all together it was like 4.05 for 24 of the condoms they come in the blue color i thought they were going to be in a silver package but it doesnt mate. They look great cant wait to try them
__label__1 gets dry very quickly: this condom gets dry very quickly. One needs extra lubricant. People who give favorable review on this condom have not tried better condoms.
__label__1 very very bad customer service and a totally rib off!!!: I have ordered 20 of 12 okamoto crown condoms, the total price for the comdoms is a little over 30 dollors, but they charge me overm 90 for the shipping!! It is much more expensive than the pirce I can buy in the retails stores! They charge the pircie as 20 different shippment but they ship me as one package (very light and small). I thought that was one order, but they charge me as 20 orders. I guess the shipment only cost them less than 10 dollors (grand shipping by post office), what a rib off!!
__label__1 it breaks easier: be careful, when using this. This is super thin. It will break if your gf is not wet enough.warning!
__label__2 Exelent, real diference: the condoms look really small, but, once you put on are really confortable. Maybe if you're a horse (more than 8" or 9")it's not going to work for you but if you're in the range 6"-8" it's ok. The feeling improove in about a 15% and you can feel it!. I totally recomended. 4 stars beacause any condom it's perfect.
__label__2 Album of the Millenium.....so far!: First things first. Buy this record - you will not be disappointed. Pete Wylie is without doubt the most criminally ignored pop genius plying his trade today, bar none. A gifted songwriter, soaring tunesmith, motor-mouthed tub-thumping wit who can raise the hairs on the back of your kneck at will. If "A Word to the Wiseguy" was his political rant, his "Boys from the Backstuff - the Musical", then this is his personal album, his "Blood on the Tracks" meets the E Street Shuffle produced by Phil Spector. An absolute tip-top industrial strength grade A gem.Oh, and by the way, just in case you weren't listening earlier, buy this record - you won't regret it.
__label__2 Good Finale: This book explores the life of Olivia Winfield (a.k.a the Grandmother in Flowers in the Attic) Olivia is a 24 year "old maid" who's life is changed when the rich, aloof Malcolm Foxworth impulsively asks her to marry him. But upon arrival to her new home she discovers that she is only there to give birth to an heir. THis is a well-written book which tells you how someone so nice can turn into someone so evil, but I took off a star for the glaring errors that pepper this book.
__label__2 Weird, But Good Book: Strange things definitely happen in this book, like Olivia staying married to Malcolm, when she definitely had the means to leave. Locking Alicia away for something that was not her fault was another strange thing about this book. Overall, it is a good book with a lot of twists and keeps you guessing.
__label__2 The prequel to Flowers in the Attic: If you've always wondered why the grandmother in Flowers in the Attic was so mean, this book is for you. This is Olivia Foxworth's story of how it all began. A great novel, one of my favorties!
__label__1 shirt fine company is a junk mailer: Shirt arrive in good condition BUT the company filled my mailbox with junk mail so much so that I had to out a block on anythig that came from them
__label__1 Very disappointing: As a big fan of Rimsky Korsakov's operas (I have at least one audio recording of all of his operas and am collecting the DVDs as they slowly come along), I was looking forward to this production of May Night. I was disappointed. The recorded sound is poor (distant) and the production itself - sets and costumes - is quite odd.For me, decoding the action required a libretto with stage directions and fortunately a complete libretto came with the 1994 Saison Russe recording.We have been fortunate to have some of Rimsky's operas show up in good to excellent DVD productions: Le Coq d'Or, Sadko, Mlada, Tsar's Bride. Even the quirky and drastically cut Tsar Saltan of Harry Kupfer is wonderful in comparison to this newest entry. Let's hope a good Kitezh or Snow Maiden comes along at some point.
__label__1 Poor Graphics, Cheap animation.: This game is addicting, but the graphics are disaterous, and the sound clips like mad, maybe it's just my computer but the game seems to be pretty lame and pointless. (BTW I have a PIII 900MHZ, 512MB DDRAM)
__label__2 Worthy Software Game!: When I looked at this game without opening it, I thought to myself it reminded me of Roller Coaster Tycoon. The graphics are very detailed and wonderful! I tried and game out. Let me tell you, if you love RollerCoaster Tycoon, you will adore this game!You can build secure exhibits so people can see animals like the elephant, penguin, and sea lion. But be careful. If you don't have a strong enough fence or a fence monkies can't climb out of, or your animals can escape and terrorize your guests!There are many buildings to add to the fun like a Japanese Garden or Animal Show.So all together, the gameplay is pretty much the same as RollerCoaster Tycoon, only this is a zoo instead of a themepark. =o)
__label__2 ZooTycoon Rocks!!: Zoo Tycoon is the best computer game i've ever had! It keeps me busy for hours and I never get bored. With expansion packs it's even more fun. I would suggest it for anyone who likes animals and is interested in zoos. You also learn about animals and what they like in their exhibits. The graphics are really good and the sounds are cool too. It's a little hard when you start out but it gets easier. It's the best game ever!
__label__2 Works fine at half the price: The picture for this shows a totally black tire, but the sidewalls are tan. However that matches what I had and I bought two for only a little more that what one would cost at the local Trek dealer. It was easy to install with no tools and works well so far.
__label__2 No kidding: My dog ate this book the first day we left her alone in the same room with it. Seriously.
__label__1 Don't be fooled!: The cover shows a cute, silly picture of a dog. I was expecting greeting card type goofy pictures and captions. The pictures were okay, the captions were tasteless, sick and far from funny. What a waste.
__label__2 Dain Curse in full: Love the quality of the movieI have a high def wide screen tvwent to the ROOT MENUthe audio had an echo like the sound in a movie theatreAdjusted the audio from Theatre to Living Room and that corrected the musicBUT I still got the echo on my tv for the talkingI played it on my computer--and worked very wellI will have to deal with my tv later! It readjusted the whole tv system.Ah the good old days before HD and all that jazz!There must be a sound adjustment I haven't adjusted yet.
__label__2 Excellent Resource: I have used many of the team challenges in this book in my work in youth ministry and public education. There are ideas for everything from ice-breakers to large group challenges that are very effective for building community and encouraging people to work together toward a common goal while having fun at the same time. While some of the ideas require more complex props, many can be done with items you have readily available around the house or office. All of the ideas would work as effectively with youth or adults in a variety of settings. Best of all, the text is written in Rohnke's witty style that makes reading about the games almost as fun as playing them.
__label__1 AWEFUL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!: these earings are the worst! they are way too heavy and the rocks on the bottom weent the same color! on was grey and one was black! I dont recommend this!
__label__1 Helpful but full of mistakes: Although this pocketbook is helpful for beginners it has one big mistake: phrases and words are written in Amharic letters (which is a good thing) but the authors were really careless when they proofread the book. In many cases the word (or phrase) written in Amharic does not correspond to it's English translation ... which leads to misunderstandings as soon as one uses the book for nonverbal communication (and that was the idea behind the usage of amharic letters)!
__label__1 Kindle Version Must Be Beta: Whoever digitized this book was not paying attention. There are header lines (title and author)in the middle of the screen, text lines end in the middle, page numbers appear in the middle of paragraphs.I like this author and would, perhaps, enjoy this story if there weren't so many distractions due to poor editing. Save your money until someone fixes this version!
__label__1 what can I use to upgrade...???: I have office 4.2.1 will this count as an upgrade???? I don't want to buy this and find out that it won't! I hate office, but love entourage and if I qualify for the upgrade, it's actually cheaper than buying entourage on its own!
__label__1 DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY: DESPITE READING THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS, I BOUGHT IT ANYWAY. THE WEIGHT PART WAS OK, BUT I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THE AEROBICS PART OF THE TAPE. DANCE STEPS TOO HARD TO FOLLOW, CAMERA ANGLES BAD. BORING...TO MUCH YELLING IN BACKGROUND.
__label__1 There is more "Bad" about this DVD than just Religion.: This DVD has VERY terrible sound and VERY low budget video footage. The only good thing is it has alot of songs, and the riot is somewhat interesting. Bad Religion is a good band, but this DVD is awful!! :(You will feel ripped off if you buy this!! Borrow it first, if you can, before buying it!!! I guess this DVD could always be used as an expensive cup coaster.
__label__1 Disappointed - they tricked me: I feel cheated in some way. I heard Jack Blades and Tommy Shaw on The Howard Stern Show playing ACOUSTIC versions of these songs. I liked the sound a lot. Then I bought the CD and found that none of the songs on the CD are acoustic at all.I'm a big Jack Blades and Tommy Shaw fan otherwise I wouldn't have purchased the CD at all, but these songs are really just cheap karaoke versions of great songs. Shaw-Blades bring nothing new to them. The sound is VERY watered down. Like Muzak in an elevator. My advice would be to just buy the original versions of these songs as performed by the original artists.I'll show mercy and give it two stars (which it doesn't deserve) because I did like California Dreamin' (although even with that one give me the original).Shame on you Shaw-Blades, are you really that hard up for money at this point in your career that you need to release a karaoke CD ?
__label__2 Truely awsome: Ralph Towner has got to be one of the finest guitarists thathas ever lived. This live album is spectacular. I have hadthe great fortune of seeing Ralph perform live on severaloccasions in the 1970's: solo, with Oregon, and with thePaul Winter Consort. His performances were nothing butawe inspiring! This album is a masterpiece and its LIVE!
__label__2 great A/V RECIEVER: my second yamaha A/V reciever my first was A 2nd from top rxv-2090 it came out on the fringe of home theatre it had a excelent amp but a little out of date as far as home theatredecoding beeing its based on 5 channels not 5.1knowing i needed a updated after hearing my girl friends get this! 300$ home theatre in a box i realized while my 2090 sounded better the timming was better on her cheep system . Still I am surprised at how much better the HTR-5590 sounded my first dolbly digital movie blew my mind don't forget i had a 1500$ 1995 model yamaha witch was very good too ,i would give it a 4.5 but no option for it here
__label__1 Unimpressed: The book has a lot of detailed step by step information on how the author runs his consulting business; however, he comes across as a greedy egomaniac. I was unimpressed. One chapter in the book suggests developing passive income like writing books. I was upset that I bought this books to feed this man's ego and revenue stream. Consider the Patrick Lencioni book series instead.
__label__2 A breath of fresh air!: This album is by far one of the best underground albums I've ever heard. It is a very unique blend of Russian/gypsy style music and good ole rock'n'roll. The magic created by this Colorado band is a wonderful breath of fresh air in the mostly stagnant popular music scene of the last few years. I challange anyone to listen to this album and NOT be dancing their all over the place!
__label__2 Good product, good value: I recently bought two pair of these noise cancelling headphones to replace earlier headphones we had bought from Radio Shack. We wanted to upgrade quality while not going through the roof in price. I did a fair amount of online research and decided to buy the well regarded PXC 300s and am not disappointed at all. My wife and I use these for traveling. We travel overseas and try to be pretty light, so the ability to fold up and become quite compact was a strong plus. Comfortable to wear - not too much pressure on the head. Good noise suppression. I'm sure that we would get better fidelity (and bulk) with Bose, but at barely $100 per pair these are an excellent choice.
__label__2 Outstanding noise canceling: I use these both in airline travel and at the gym. The noise canceling feature functions well in airplanes. In the the gym, it blocks nearly all the other noises and helps block the pain of exercise.
__label__2 Noise Cancelling Earphones: Ease of use - excellentBattery life- lasted a flight to/from Hawaii and still in useDecreased cabin noise - good (nothing else to compare it to)Sound quality - very goodPrice - not as expensive as Bose
__label__1 Couldn't even finish this one: I totally agree with the other one star reviewers. I only fought part-way through the book before I pushed it aside in disgust. While a fiction work, the main character is supposed to give you a sense of who John was. The book portrays him as a hot-headed legalistic old man, quick to anger, cowardly, and needing to be led by those he had mentored. Where are his fruits of the Spirit? Where is the wisdom he would have from walking with the Master all those years? The words he spoke in the book were drivel. If you want a good fiction book to read (sorry I can't vouch for the historical accuracy) try Francine Rivers Mark of the Lion series. It's a three part series. I highly recommend the first two books.
__label__2 Mixing historical with fictional fill-in interesting: Book of John is my favorite of the Gospel accounts of Jesus Christ's ministry on earth. I like the mix of what is historically known about the apostle John with the fictional story to fill in and make an interesting read. Then The Gospel of John and the 3 Epistles written by John are also included at the end of the book.Have also read the other "Jesus Chronicles" by same authors about Matthew, Mark, and Luke. I recommend all of them.Love being able to download books to the Kindle App on my Toshiba Thrive Tablet.
__label__2 Great: This book is in great shape no missing pages hardly any damage. I am very happy with the service I received, I will be a returning customer.
__label__1 Don't expect to pass the exam!!: I have read the first book out of the four (Windows 2000 Professional (70-210). Studied it inside and out. Took the sample test in the CD-ROM and got 98% on it. I thought I was ready for the exam so I went and took the 70-210 exam. Well, this book did not even come close to what the exam was like. The questions were much, much harder and longer scenerio type. I did not pass the exam. If you are looking to just learn Windows 2000 Professional really well, then these books are good. If you are looking to take the MCSA or MCSE exams then don't count on these books to help you pass.
__label__1 Really Poor Product, maybe it was just mine: The reviews were great on this products, that is why I bought it.But when received mine in the mail and tried it out, It was completely useless, I think the worst 10 Dollars I have ever spent.It would not grip any hair of mine, the quality felt very poor, I had better experiences with tweezers from Walmart.Really disappointed.
__label__2 The tweezer of tweezers: This tweezer is the epitome of what a tweezer should be. It even comes with a little storage case. Can't wait for my next splinter...
__label__1 Tweezerman Mini Slant Tweezer: I do not like the slant Tweezers, they do not grip little hairs properly. Much prefer the straight tip and also the scissors type, which appear to be unobtainable at present. Not a happy chappy!
__label__2 A good book for those with experiance with x86 assembly: This book does not serve as a tutorial to learn assembly; rather it goes into many uses of assembly, such as reverse engineering, and protection from a virus. If you know assembly already, and want to use it more effectively, this would be a good book
__label__2 Worth it..: Explains how to view education in terms of the whole person. There are also people you can meet who can help you follow this approach. This is the real genius of the author: he not only wrote well but there are people who he has educated in this way and who are available to get to know.
__label__2 If you plan to purchase only one Nelons release, this is it.: This has become my favorite southern gospel tape. The group has made full use of the members' vocal talents. The result is a blend of soaring harmonies, and little twists and turns, that will have you placing your ear next to the player in order not to miss a single note!
__label__1 On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection ...: The true title that Darwin gave this thesis is: "On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life." Amazon.com makes no mention of this. Darwin believed that the peoples of Africa were inferior.
__label__2 This smells good!: You only THINK it's a kid's scent. But this stuff is MANLY. It's a bit citrusy, kinda spicy... I get compliments on it all the time. Seriously, buy this. I can't recommend it enough.
__label__2 Addendum.: Mistaking the trees for the wood, I forgot to mention the most important aspect of Bresson's last masterpiece, 'L'Argent': one of the greatest shots in all cinema. In the immediate aftermath of a domestic murder, blood flecked on dully garish wallpaper is briefly illumined by a fallen lampshade before it's extinguished. Shattering.
__label__2 Resonant.: This isn't on the level of Kangaroo Jack or Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle, but it'll do.
__label__1 horrible: Purchased because it was a good price and was comfortable for baby. Regret completely. The crotch latch is so short and uncomfortable for baby. Worst problem was trying to remove the pad for cleaning. Out of three carseats owned, this is the WORST to clean and put back together. Horrible!
__label__1 Don't waste your money: Don't waste your money. Not worth the time to download much less the purchase price. When it does start, the display doesn't refresh properly and the screen fills up with garbage and you can't see what is happening on the screen.
__label__2 Great show!: I used to live in New Orleans and remember seeing the crews filming this show all around my neighborhood. It's a great show with a great cast...and, most importantly, a great tribute to New Orleans!
__label__2 The Death Committiee: A gripping in depth story which historically records the training and emotional depth of those who choose to become key players in the medical community.A must read which will jar your emotions and expose the drama the determination and dedication of those who want to be contributors in the medical revolution.
__label__1 Not happy with this: The whole point of going wireless was the move the computer to a spot I could see on the bike, but to finally get this to work it was almost on the tire itself and even a shorter distance than the wired unit that I had. Went to using my iPhone and a free app on that to track all my information, it worked out better than anything I tried. Ended up giving this unit away.
__label__1 Poor quality: This product came with 2 pieces that are warped - so the oven door closes too far and the fridge door won't close all the way. The stove / sink top piece is split and the screw holes for the faucet were drilled too small.I would not recommend.
__label__1 Disappointing video.: I must admit I was quite disappointed with this video. The video is advertised as a collection of period car commercials and promotional films. It is that indeed.My problem with the video is that the commercials and short promos are all of mundane subject matter. There are no classic commercials or promos of the performance models, the rare trim levels, the more desirable luxury models. As an example, one promo was about the (relative) fuel economy of the Chevrolet Impala compared to it's Ford and Chrysler competitors in which each car had a glass container mounted on the hood showing how much fuel was left as each car drove along a test track. This is not exactly what I would call an interesting classic car commercial.The segment on the Corvair was okay, so I gave this two-stars. Overall, to me, this wasn't worth the money unless one is interested in how many shopping bags can be put into the trunk of a Dodge Polara compared to others in its class.
__label__2 Too Complex: I am a long time US Robotics Pilot 1000 to Palm V user who has been thrilled with the battery life and utter simplicity of the palm series. This device doesn't even come close on the basic aspect of calendar entry or viewing. The day/week/month chooser on the palm is always on the calender screen. With iPaq it is always at least two clicks away. Neither one will allow greater that 1/2 hr apptments that are clearly distinguished. The screen however, just absolutely leave Palm in the dust.... If Palm Vc was out with the screen on the iPaq I would have bought it a year ago....However, it will virtually always eliminate one of Palms other big attractions and that is either the loooong life of very simple and inexpensive batteries.
__label__2 parts purchase: Kudos to the guys that helped me purchase this part. I had been through many local parts stores and everyone had me waiting many days or weeks even and alot more pricey. I will definitely go to these guys again and I highly recommend them!
__label__1 Typical 80's T & A: I remember back as a teenager watching "A Current Affair" when Maury Povich was still the host. There was a story on this very movie because the opening scene was filmed at a high school and consisted of 20 or so scantilly clad women and a voluptuous teacher that greeted the hero with the line, "Is that an apple in your pocket or are you just glad to see me?" Obviously, this was a dream sequence, but nontheless, I think that alone was worth the $3.00 I paid for this movie. The rest is pretty much mind-numbing.
__label__1 Not happy: I thought it was advanced poses. Instead it was some kind of breathing! It was a waste of my money.
__label__2 Worth Listening To: The early years of Tangerine Dream produced some incredible music. Although Mirage lacks some of the drama of Schulze in the Tangerine Dream days, it is a very competent effort that makes for pleasant listening.After listening to this album, you can start to identify Schulze's contribution to Tangerine Dream, and also the musical personality of Klaus Schulze himself.
__label__2 the BEST for many reasons: This performance is one of my favorites in a large collection of dance videos. Not only for the dancers and choreography, but the music, too.
__label__2 great package!: This package is definately worth the price. I got it for my palm and couldn't stop playing it. If you are ever bored in meetings or just sitting around the house, this is a great way to have some fun. Me and my kids love it. It is just like the shooting games at the arcade. I would definately recommend it. If you liked this one I would also recommend the 100 great games for the palm.
__label__2 Undiscovered Treasure: I believe Shirley Horn and this CD are an undiscovered treasure. Well into her seventies and not recently in the best of health, Ms. Horn is a national treasure for jazz lovers. While she barely sings above a whisper, her emotion,timing and phrasing are on par with Sinatra--heady company indeed. This album showcases her vocal and piano skills in a golden light.Combined with the lush overlay of Johnny Mandel's beautiful string arrangements, this is a truly glorious cd that stays with you. Rarely have I seen a CD described on Amazon in such universally passionate and glorious terms.
__label__1 Shirley Horn, "Here's To Life": There is only one word for this CD - - -DELICIOUS ! ! ! ! Went back and bought two more for friends. They agreed with me. ENJOY
__label__2 Lippincott: This is a thick book with tons of information. Guaranteed to help out any nursing student or even just a good book to have as a nurse. However, it is hard to navigate this book, it takes some looking around before you can figure it out.
__label__2 Highland 91338 Triple Strength Bungee Cord Assortment: So far very good set. Wish they had more that were the same size in the set but the quality of the cords has been very good
__label__1 I'm glad this was free.: If I had had to pay for this, I'd be returning it. Impractical and old-fashioned, with ingredients I've never heard of or have no way of finding. Mace? Turtle? REALLY?
__label__1 Helen Fisher's "Final Solution": This book makes it clear that Helen Fisher hates men. If a man wrote a book like this from the male perspective, he would be justly crucified by the media. This book is a blow to the good reputation of the Anthropology Department at Rutgers University, where she was apparently employed at the time of publication. I would like to say something positive about the book, in order to balance out some of the negatives, but I can't think of anything except maybe that it is a good addition to the library of anyone who collects the works of notable bigots. In short, a truly horrible book.
__label__1 can you say CREEPY: Let me say that I had never heard of Diane Arbus before watching this movie. In a nutshell, She meets the stranger living in the attic of her apartment bldg who has a medical condition that makes his appearance that of a werewolf. He is just as creepy as she is. She falls "madly" in love with him, takes up photography with the majority of her photos being that of his hallway and front door (yes thats right), neglects her family and becomes weirdly obsessed with her hairy lover. Strange movie. I found it disturbing.
__label__1 What's the Point?: First of all, why make a film that is an "imaginary portrait" of Diane Arbus? It consists of a made-up story about Arbus and a neighbor with a medical condition that makes him hairy all over. Kidman, of course, is wonderful, Robert Downey, Jr. is very disappointing, and ultimately the viewer is disappointed too. I suppose Arbus' real life story wasn't interesting enough.
__label__1 In-fur-iating: This movie is really quite unfortunate. Diane Arbus was a fascinating woman and her life should have gotten the treatment it deserved. They had been debating for years about how best to approach this... what won out was probably the worst idea. It is fictional and only loosely based on her amazing life. It is pretty insulting to her memory. The fictional allegorical love affair with her upstairs neighbor is kind of insulting for it portrays her as a naive woman needing a masculine figure to bring out her artistic notions. The character itself pays homage to Lionel the Lion-Faced man and imagines a meeting/romance. They even change her kid's names for no reason. I hope another film does it right.
__label__2 Keeps 4yo son busy: It was easy enough for my son to figure out and keep him occupied during long car rides.
__label__1 Another "Poor little Women" novel....: Gina and Lawrence are the main characters of the book. The were best friends in childhood and that friendship continues into adulthood. Both are married to other people and when Gina's marriage ends she ends up in at Lawrences house being comforted in his arms. His wife is somewhat understanding but feels that Gina often outstays her welcome. Gina goes through every "poor me" emotion from the divorce and it gets obnoxiously annoying! Will someone please write a book where the betrayed women moves on and becomes strong without having to virtually distroy her teenage childrens' lives too?!!!I won't go into detail of what happens next in case you decide to read this boring novel but let's just say that it's predictable, yet boring, with no really likeable characters. Very flatly written! I give it 2 stars...
__label__1 Why would anyone pay to have an ad: Especially one this uninformative, in their cubicle. I would be reluctant to TAKE money to put up this poster.
__label__1 The Vice Season Two a disappointment: Season One of The Vice was just terrific. Good writing and, of course, Ken Stott is a fine actor. But Season Two moves like molasses, certainly the first two episodes. Endless, dragging, repetitive, no action. The writers sadly appear to have let the series down. Here's to hoping they regain their initial touch.
__label__1 Natural Selection among people: ----------- -----------1) The mechanism of natural selection among people explained:"the races or species of men, whichever term may be applied, encroach on and replace one another, so that some finally become extinct"2) The way this encroachment until extinction occurs among people:"Extinction follows chiefly from the competition of tribe with tribe,and race with race. (...) when of two adjoining tribes one becomes less numerous and less powerful than the other, the contest is soon settled by war, slaughter, cannibalism, slavery, and absorption."3) The morality of Darwinism:"The highest possible stage in moral culture is when we recognise that we ought to control our thoughts, and "not even in inmost thought to think again the sins that made the past so pleasant to us."1,2,3 those are the main things in the book in my opinion. It fails on standards of systemacy, abstraction, exactitude, verification, logic/reasoning, neutrality and formalising of theory.
__label__1 Very week book: How this got printed I dont know. Wish I could have seen samples of the tutorials before I purchased online. (...)
__label__1 A comparison of two books...: I purchased both the Princeton Review and the Kaplan GRE 1999-2000 edition book. I found that while the Princeton Review book had some good pointers, the Kaplan book was better organized and a lot easier (for me at least) to study from. If you're only going to buy one book, I'd suggest passing this one up and getting the Kaplan book.What really sold me on Kaplan was the fact that they divided up their list of vocab words into categories, instead of one big list.
__label__2 A Superb Textbook!: Death, Society, and the Human Experience is a wonderful textbook! I have been using it in my class The Sociology of Death and Dying for the past four years. This book provides the information necessary to any real understanding and examination of societal assumptions and attitudes toward death and dying. It not only enhances the knowledge of the student but provides the groundwork for new readers in the field. The book is a beautiful presentation of stimulating facts that will help everyone confront death and dying in a more personal and lasting manner.
__label__2 Five Stars: Excellent Service. Unit installed easily and worked perfectly like factory original. I would highly recommend this company for all your door opener needs.
__label__2 Love them: These floor mats are very durable and fit perfectly in our truck. Living in back country with the mud and snow they have held up perfectly. Would recommend to everyone.
__label__2 Indiana Jones and the Dance of the Giants: I am a 62 year-old kid who can't get enough of Indy (young or old, and whatever comes next). MacGregor's, Dance of the Giants is well written, with plenty of history,archeologial sites and adventure to suit me. That is, of course, if one can really have enough adventure. These little stories read very fast, so I try to read them slow and savor every page. I highly reccommend the Indiana Jones Series of books.
__label__2 A Peruvian Portrait of Ordinary Lives: Written 50 years ago, this uniquely-styled novel, with multi-page single paragraph passages apparently used to render community scenes in a unified format seems to me to be a kind of impressionist painting in words, sliding fluidly between a smallish back country city on the edge of the desert and an island village in the upper reaches of the Amazon, with a motley population of mostly poor but proud peasants and indians, some living by smuggling contraband, others by the central elaborate [...] house where an old harp player leads a combo of local musicians. The hopes and fears, successes and failures, of the protagonists translate neither to heroes nor villains, and sad or happy events follow each other in timeless progression. The respected writer produced subsequent superior works, but this difficult effort still deserves patronage.
__label__1 What's Her Problem?: I read this book and it's obvious that Eartha Kitt has a problem with being black. She claims that the reason they didn't show the movie she was in with Sammy Davis Jr. in the South, was because the racist Southerners might believe she was white. If Eartha Kitt thinks that she would be mistaken for white, then excuse me, but this is the Queen of England typing this review.
__label__1 Another Scam: I was ok with ordering this inexpensive mask for my son because I thought it would come with the tinted glass that is shown, because that's all he really wants. It's unfortunate that these fly by night paintball companies take advantage of people advertising one product but actually delivering another. Last time I order anything from this company.
__label__2 an all time great...: To many hamsun readers this one will seem to be quite a departure for Hamsun, as it is an urban tale centering around a bohemian clique, rather than the usual tale of the Norwegian peasantry. As I know only those that are already Hamsun fans will ever read this, let it suffice to say that this book is as good as any of his works (even Pan), so hurry up and get a copy...
__label__2 Unsurpassed "Milkwood": Richard Burton, Elizabeth Taylor, and Peter O'Toole bring Dylan Thomas's lyrical masterpiece to life. The lilting and hilarious verse roles from the actors like wonderful music. Even one who did not understand English would appreciate the musical joy of the recording.The performance captures the hilarity and the pathos of Thomas's portrait of human life and love.This is a near definitive version of the play and should be part of the collection of any lover of Dylan Thomas's exquisite language.
__label__2 Great little product: I bought this little toy at a local auto mart and it has saved the day. It holds the charge for weeks and has never failed me in jumpstarting a car. I leave it in my wife's car during the winter months in case her battery doesn't start and it works great.Definitely a high recommendation.
__label__1 poor construction for terminals: Seems ok at first, charged fine as advertised. Used it 3 times in the first day i had it charged (lucky timing!) and the negative terminal connector flew apart each time. Had to reassemble each time and it still is shakey. Very frustrating in that attaching to anything of any size causes it to self-destruct. Now I've taken to just holding it on to something a la a defribulator and hoping for the best. Would not buy again.
__label__1 Poor product: I have had 2 faulty units right out of the box. The first would not hold a charge for more than a couple of days and that did not improve after cycling the battery a number of times. I returned it for a replacement and that 2nd unit never indicated a full charge - even after being on charge for several days. I am moving on to another brand.Don't waste your time and money on these poor quality items.
__label__2 Chevrolet Inline Six-Cylinder Power Manual: I found this book to be very informative and easy to understand. I had been looking for sometime, for any information reguarding the chevrolet inline six cylinders, 250 and 292. It really help me with the knowledge and unstanding of this inline six cylinder motor, that i find to be very inpressive and highly underated by most small block V-8 chevy motor heads. I just wish I could have found this book long before I finished building my motor. But that's ok, I already have plans for the next motor and I will be refering to this book when building torque and horsepower.
__label__2 True story of 1st stages of struggle to free Soviet Jews.: His history and outline of the JDL ideology should be read by every Jew--whether or he or her agrees with Kahane.Read especially what he says about Jabotinsky.
__label__2 You're nuts if you don't have this book in your library!: One of the finest books on Hollywood's master photographer, George Hurrell. The author not only is an expert in his own right, but he knew Hurrell. That special blend along with the fact the author knows how to write and chose some wonderful never seen before photos makes this book one very satisfying bedtime meal. Great reading
__label__2 A Peek at the Glamour that Once Was: Hurrell's art is amazing. The actors who were defined by his photography owed him their careers. He made each one of them look as if they stepped out of a dream. He was trudly remarkable in his craft.
__label__1 buyer beware!: The "search inside" feature of this ad shows gorgeous, color photographs of the birds; HOWEVER, the actual book's photos are in black and white! Admittingly, the photos here are more accurate than Dover's older version's drawings, but you will still need to refer to another source for color photos/drawings. If you already own an older copy, don't bother with this one! If you are buying for the first time, you will appreciate the large, clear photos, but know that they are all in black and white.Spacing of the text is another problem I have with this publisher's version. The lines of text are too close together for easy reading. Dover's version is easier on the eyes.
__label__2 happy customer: I am a very satisfied customer. The shipment was received extremely fast! The hat is in perfect condition. No complaints. Thanks!
__label__2 Wonderful Book: I bought this book because I had read 'So You Want to Be a Wizard' (the first book in the series to which this book is the sixth) when I was in elementary school, and for nostalgia's sake, I wanted to read the whole series. The book came in perfect condition (save a few dings in the softcover from shipping). It was well worth the money!!
__label__2 Insightful and Interesting: This book is about a social worker , who after years of helping others, must save herself from the grip of manic depression. Her struggle to get her life back together after a manic episode will touch your heart. The author shows a great deal of insight in sharing the many ways mental illness has touched her life and the lives of her family members. Overall the book is emotionally powerful, informative and well written.
__label__2 I agree, Joshy Hell is an Idiot: Inspired by the below review, I also wanted to chime in an call Icy Hell an idiot. I will definitely buy this album (maybe 2 copies) and revel in the mainstream tones
__label__2 Good Light - Better for "being seen": I think this is a great set - the lights are small and easy to install (the rear light easily fits on my Topeak rack), but these lights are better for being seen than seeing. That's great for the rear light: it does its job well. But the front light could use a little more horsepower if you intend on lighting the way.
__label__2 A gentle soul was Vincent Van Gogh: Stone takes the reader on a fascinating journey recapping Vincent Van Gogh's life of hardships and triumphs in his biographical novel Lust for Life. Beginning in London, the author reveals Vincent's inner core as a young man of twenty-one working as a clerk for European art dealers while falling madly in love with a vivacious nineteen-year-old kindergarten teacher. Vincent's reaction to this unrequited relationship establishes a pattern of behavior and insight into his personality, which makes him more empathetic as a character. Vincent leaves London and embarks on journey in search of his "true calling" and ends up as a minister living in abject poverty in a Belgium miners' village. This situation strengthens his character and weakens his faith, but out of that grows a passion for art and drawing. The obsession begins and so does his real journey. This book is well worth reading.
__label__2 AN ARTIST'S LIFE: IRVING STONE HAS HIS READERS RELIVE VINCENT VAN GOGH'S LIFE.AFTER READING THE BOOK YOU CAN EASILY APPRECIATE THE TUMULTOUS LIFE THIS ARTIST HAD.THE AURTHOR HAS USED CERTAIN FICTIONAL MOMENTS AS HE AGREES TO IN THE END.THESE ONLY MAKE THE BOOK MORE READWORTHY.THE EMPHASIS IN THIS BOOK IS ON THE LIFE OF VINCENT VAN GOGH IN RELATION TO THE ART HE PRODUCED.ONE OF MY PERSONAL FAVOURITES.
__label__1 Buyer Beware!!! Rain haven!: We have had this sandbox for about a year and it is constantly filling with rain water. Flimsy lid does not fit correctly and Little Tikes will do nothing without a dated receipt within 1yr - basically told us too bad. Buy the Step 2!!!
__label__2 Obsessive Genius: It was a wonderful biography of Marie Curie and very interesting but there were times I got lost in all the technology and chemistry of it. I would rate it a 4 1/2 but the stars above wouldn't let me rate it that way. What an amazing woman and what amazing accomplishments and contributions she made especially in that time.
__label__2 AWESOME: Just got this sub to replace my sony 8 inch sub. I plugged this sub in, put on a cd and this thing rocks. The lows hit so low and sound awesome with my Klipsch Quintet SL Home Theater System. If you are looking for a great sub for movies and music then GET THIS SUB! You will not be disappointed.
__label__1 Where are the sources?: This book is fantasy. It uses very few sources to support crucial elements and hypothesis and boils down to a delusional opinion of a Right Wing conspiracy theorist. The author refuses to debate this material because it is far fetched and unrealistic and it should **NOT** be taken seriously. It uses eyewitnesses who were in Nanking as sources when they agree with the author; however then when those sources refute the author's opinion, they are cast out. Read this if you want to know how NOT to conduct serious historical research. The author should be labeled as a right wing fanatic and illusionist; this should be listed under "fantasy/fiction".
__label__1 revisionist history at its worst: According to this book there was no Rape of Nanking ,it was all Nationalist Chinese propaganda. The book is just not true, it presents a lot of facts but ignores others.It doesent read well
__label__1 very poor quality: I purchased this item a few months ago and just took it out of the box for my daughter born the end of November...well all the padding has completely broken down and flaked all over!!!! I now have a complaint against combi pending and now must purchase a new seat because i will not put her in this one!!!!!!!!!do not purchase!!!!! who only knows what the material is made of( it was made in Italy)less then 1 star
__label__1 How to Show Your Own Dog: Fortunately this book is currently out of print, and should stay that way. The illustrations and pictures throughout the book date back to the late fifties and sixties. No where in the book does MS Nichols discuss in any detail the finer points of actually showing your purebred dog. To her benefit she did a very good job of depicting what it is like to attend a dog show and how champions earn their pionts. Unfortunatly, most of this information is not laid out in any organized manner. At times I felt like I was having a friendly cup of coffee as she skipped from one thought to another. Her biggest inside tip under the chapter "Tricks of the Trade" was "Keep your nose clean, your eyes and ears open, and your mouth closed until you know what it is all about." Good advice since you won't learn what showing your own dog is about from this source.
__label__2 You have to see this Sherlock Holmes Film ... !!!: This one had escaped me ... you cannot believe the Actor who played Minister of Magic ... Fudge was it ... in the Harry Potter Series ... I never liked him in Harry Potter because he was so fake and luke warm (wishy washy) ... BUT you will loathe him in this film - a nasty evil sort of dude - causing more uneasiness because of the psycholigical nature of his crimes ... you'd have more sympathy for him if he ran around shooting people ... not that that's good either .... he really makes a mean blackmailer. The only movie I've ever liked him in was Sense & Sensibility.
__label__1 Pigs at the Trough: This was a very poorly written book. It was repetitive, rambling and boring. I suspect she had someone write it to make money.
__label__1 too little details, too much sarcasm: First of all, 20% of the words in this book seem to be devoted to sarcasm- it was funny at first but then became tiresome. The book follows the pattern of telling you what's wrong, who's guilty, and how much money that person sucked from the American taxpayer. Personally I'm more interested in the details of the loopholes. How do offshore tax havens work? How do corporate lobbyists operate in Washington? These details aren't available in Pigs at the Trough.
__label__2 Riotous: Mercifully, Arianna injects enough humor into this book to keep the reader out of the inevitable funk that would come from the revelations inside. Well done.
__label__2 No-nonsense truth from a no-nonsense woman: Arianna Huffington is a rare treasure...a political pundit who states the truth without sugar coating it. She is brilliant,insightful, and she has a great sense of humor. Her writing adds some exciting life and laughter to very serious issues.This book is a must read for capitalist pigs and those that hate them.
__label__2 Good Book for RESNET test: Took a class to become a Class 1 Florida Home Rater. This book was given to every student in the class. It seems to have quality information that is put in a simple format to read.Before I took the National RESNET test(passed), I highlighted and tab the book which was very useful come test time. I also bought the Online version and up it to my web site so I could use adobe search at test time.I found the online book not to be as beneficial because I was faster using my tabs. So I would recommend the Soft book version over the Online Adobe version. I think you learn more by highlighting and tabbing an actual book too.If you plan to take the National RESNET Test then this book is a must to have.
__label__2 Great book: This the second book I have read of his, and it was well paced and kept my interest.Plan on reading more of his work.
__label__1 If you're a Bela fan, you will have to see it!: The Devil Bat is a real poverty row effort from the 1940s, when Bela Lugosi was being offered roles of diminishing quality. That being said, it does have a certain campy charm,as Lugosi trains his electrically enlarged bats to kill at the scent of his special shaving lotion formula! The big bat has to be seen to be believed, and its attack cry is really something. All in all, a fun hour of viewing.
__label__2 Favorite: Robin Hood was my children's all time favorite! I still sing those songs in my head. So glad we can share this with our grands.
__label__2 It's the best: I consider this the "original" Robin Hood. I never realized as a kid that this was one of my all-time favorite movies, but as an adult I realize that it was. I LOVE the music. Classic Disney
__label__2 Robin hood: Co worker need this movie I just ordered it for her. She has not offered any complaints of the product.
__label__2 Decent Disney film: This film was done of course, in what I would call `Disney's Off Years".Not up to their usual standards, was not a huge hit. Could have been if improvements in script & characters.It is only a good film.Bringing Phil Harris as "Little John" & making "Little John" a bear just because of the success with 1967's `The Jungle Book" "Baloo" character.ONLY a 1 disc version of the film.Some extras but nothing major. No Making Of or anything like that.And, something I HATE in DVD packaging. THESE HORRIBLE CASES WITH THE LITTLE OPEN UP FLAPS!! THESE NEED TO BE DONE AWAY WITH!!
__label__2 shimmery....fresh feeling: I had used Revlon Skinlights Instant Skin Brightener in the past... LOVED it... couldn't find it in any stores anymore so went on line... was THRILLED that I could still get it... Love it....ordered three !!! :)
__label__1 Not the Coverage it Claims to Give: I purchased this product since I was looking to try something to cover my hyperpigmentation. I was already happy with a different product but I was trying to save a few dollars and at the same time give something else a try. I was not happy with the outcome. First of all, the product comes in a "chapstick" type of container and size so for my age spots, I have to use quite a lot of product. I used it before I applied my foundation and it just didn't give me the coverage my previous concealer did. I agree with the saying, "cheaper isn't always better" and will be going back to my previous concealer.
__label__1 Has Charlie from Mighty Ducks: When I rented this movie, from a friend's suggestion (he said he liked it in the seventh grade so at 26, I should like it too) I dind't really know what I was going to get. Little did I know I was going to get Charlie from the Mighty Ducks. While he's not the lovable winner from the show about ice hockey, he's still the good guy and good guys win (SPOILER ALERT).
__label__1 the worst.: Whoa boy, I've seen some pretty lame flicks last year, but The Skulls definitely comes in as one of the worst. It's a mind-bogglingly stupid tale about a pretty boy (Joshua Jackson) who stupidly decides to join a secret society, and it seems all the members of this society, called The Skulls, are pretty dumb in their own rights, too. Of course, this didn't prepare me for the lame as heck finale, which features a duel, that's right, a duel involving two flintlock pistols.
__label__1 Who DOES this remind you of?: Lightweight film, but interesting premise. The sons of wealthy, powerful families get inducted into an Ivy League secret society. In return for a vow of mutual lifetime assistance, they get all sorts of advantages (expensive cars, grad school admissions, forgivable student loans, old boy network at the highest levels of society).Best of all, their darkest secrets are whitewashed, covered up, and forgotten.Darned if this doesn't remind us of a skull currently running for president.
__label__1 The Skulls: I am a William L. Petersen fan, But if I had a choice on watching this video again or being bashed in the skull. I would take the skull bash thank you very much.
__label__1 Thai Fresh Lemongrass - 8 stalks: Exactly what I wanted, will reorder when I run out. Came fresh and makes the best tea. Thank you very much..
__label__1 how not to learn a language: I moved to spain a year ago, but in the 6 months before i left nyc i decided to take a spanish class to give me a head start.my teacher was a native spanish speaker, so i trusted his decision when he required this book. i should'nt have.i quickly realized (after 3 lessons) that you don't learn a foreign language by memorizing list of related vocabulary. i'm sure we all remember that from high school, but how many of us actually learned how to speak a language that way, no one.once in spain and entered in a school with a real book, i realized that you learn by natural assimilation of ideas. A chapter or theme might start with a silly picture or story, and go from there. as the topic is further discussed, it brings in further vocabulary in a way that is natural.memorizing lists works for no one!
__label__2 A Great Book to have: Bought this ebook primarily because I was assigned a few of its short story in my North American Writters class. The stories are amazing, my favorite ones are "Rip Van Winkle" and of course "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow".This particular edition (The Sketch-Book of Geoffrey Crayon) was free on Amazon.com and although it is very well organized and there weren't any errors that I could find, I'm docking one star for a critical flaw on the ebook's design. The table of content is not hyperlinked, so if you just want to read a certain story instead of the whole book you need to go through the entire book "page" by "page" in order to reach your desired destination. If the table of content had been hyperlinked I would have given it the full 5 stars.
__label__1 The Legend Of Sleepy Hollow And Other Stories: The book that I read was called The Legend Of Sleepy Hollow And Other Stories. The author of the book was Washington Irving. I thought that was book wasn't that great. That depends on if you don't mind an old-fashioned type of language that they spoke. I thought that the book was a little too complicated for me because I didn't understand what the people were saying sometimes.I thought that the actual theme of the book was pretty good, but otherwise I didn't really care for it that much.I'd reccomend this book to anyone who ever read the actual verson of Sleepy Hollow and liked the story.By,Andy C.
__label__1 DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY: Horrible movie. I actually laughed a lot, but it's not supposed to be a comedy. The acting was terrible, storyline bad, the way the movie was shot was supposed to be "arty" but just ended up looking like a 10 year old child did the camera work. I only gave it one star for a rating because they won't let you review an item without one. If they had a zero star rating, that's what it would get. I am sorry I wasted my money on it.
__label__1 Slow and pointless: I have read several of Steinbeck's other works. They are generally good. This book, although, is slow moving and has several irrelevant chapters thrown in. The ending is definitely not what I expected.
__label__2 Exactly what I needed: I read a review of one of these notebooks that made me think they were teeny but I was happily surprised to find that they were almost as long as my hand and fairly wide. The perfect size for a notebook to bring around with me for whenever I need to jot down a thought. I ordered a few, all of which I love, but this one is my favorite. The painting is just beautiful.
__label__1 Read The Club Dumas instead.: I bought this book because I found The Club Dumas to be excellent. I was deeply disappointed. Where The Club Dumas sparkled, The Seville Communion merely exists, and while The Club Dumas transcended its genre, The Seville Communion is deeply rooted in it. And that's a shame, because it means the mastery exhibited in The Club Dumas is a one shot deal rather than the arrival of a major literary talent
__label__1 Yawn: A handsome priest is sent by the Vatican to investigate mysterious goings-on in Seville, after a hacker breaks into the Pope's personal computer and issues a warning that a church there "kills to defend itself." The Church, "Our Lady of Tears" is slated for demolition, and two people involved in its potential closing have already been killed. Perez-Reverte provides long--I'd say overlong--descriptions both of his characters and of Seville, including, for example, list of the names of 27 bars in one section of the city. I read this book because it was on the list for my book-club. Maybe I'm just not enough of a mystery-lover, but it did nothing for me.
__label__2 A Real Pearl: Perez-Reverte disappointed me in the nautical chart book. It was artsy--too many references to books and movies, as if his characters couldn't emerge out of their actions. That's not the case here. His priests are real. That's a lot tougher than creating real cops in this world. And so's his Vatican. Dibden's CABAL works the same vein, but the comparison is all in Perez-Reverte's favor. He's closer here to DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP than to CABAL. Cather gets the 5th star; that's the only reason THE SEVILLE COMMUNION doesn't.
__label__1 Don't Bother: I had really grown to enjoy Perez-Reverte's books after first reading some of his other stories such as the Fencing Master, the Flander's Panel, and the Queen of the South. I thought I'd gotten a good bargain by purchasing this book at $.45, but sometimes it's better to hang on to loose change. In this book, the plot was weak from beginning to end, and the climax was unrealistic, even with a stretch of the imagination. I was completely disinterested in the characters whom for the most part were unlikeable, anyway. On several occasions I thought about putting the book down, and had I not been spending a week on the beach with not much else to do, I probably would have. This book gave me the impression that the author was simply trying to fulfill his contract with the publisher to write a certain number of books, regardless of quality, before a certain date.
__label__1 Review fraud: The Institute for American Indian Studies did not review this book. The attributed review originated with the author.
__label__1 TOO VAGUE: I found this book to lack depth and explanation. It vaguely lists certain herbs and plants that are of a healing nature, but the true content I was looking for was not here. I wanted more in-depth remedies for particular ailments, where this book applies certain remedies to a very hazy and small range of problems. I was also looking for a guide to ritualistic traditions rather than unmeasurable herbal concoctions.
__label__1 NOT MADE FOR THE REAL MOBILE DJ: IT DOESENT HAVE A HOLE IN THE BACK FOR THE CABLES THATS THE DOWN SIDE THATS IT U HAVE TO MAKE A HOLE AND THE AMP DIDNOT FIT HAD TO CUSTOM FIT CUTS IN FOR THE SPEAKER CABLES
__label__1 weakest of the series....: I have liked all of this series, but this one is the weakest- seems to be a lot of duplications of recipe types (ie 3 or 4 simillar fish recipes..). I still like the resturant overviews and layout tho. This one just seemed stale..(the Southern book is TERRIFIC.)
__label__2 Mixture of old & new: "Haunted Heart" starts with a blast of recorded film music that my kids recognize from Bugs Bunny. Then, it goes into "Hello My Lovely", a Charlie Haden original. Charlie Haden does a similar thing on three songs. His Quartet West plays an instrumental version of the song, then it segues into a clip of a 40's-era vocal version. Jo Stafford sings at the end of "Haunted Heart", Jeri Southern at the end of "Ev'ry Time We Say Goodbye", and Billie Holiday at the end of "Deep Song". The Quartet West plays its jazz in a very mainstream fashion. Ernie Watts is a very lush saxophone player -- his generation's Ben Webster. Mix it all together, and it's all quite romantic, though in the melodramatic sense of the word. I'm not a big fan of attaching the old songs onto the end. It doesn't work out as creatively as it should be. Still, it's a good disc, and is about in the middle range of 4-star discs.
__label__1 A Book with Some Gorey Details: Heart of a Jaguar book had an O.K. plot, and there were some good parts. However, the gorey parts made the whole book unenjoyable for me. Since many of them are not appropriate to discuss on the internet, I will not give examples - but they were disgusting. Occasionally the characters did inappropriate things, or used profane language. I know this was how people acted in Mayan days, but the discription of some things was a little bit much. So if you love reading about bloody and gorey things, you would enjoy this book.
__label__1 YAYA: The Heart of a Jaguar was a pretty o.k. novel with inaproprite parts. It tells all out about the Mayan civilization.
__label__2 Heart of a Jaguar Review: Heart of a Jaguar is a superb book for young adults. Though there is some blood and fighting explained in great detail, it is a tale of great interest. This book explains about a boy, Balam and his hardships. Balam, a descendent of the Maya, has trouble finding his place in his village. He is not a boy, but not yet a man. His village, along with many others is experiancing a great drought.Over all, Heart of a Jaguar is an extrodinary tale of a boy who is asked to make the biggest desion of his life. This novel is geared for young adults, and contains some mature material and violence.
__label__1 locking cap?: seemed like a nice heavy steel cap and would have worked great if they would have sent the rite keys for it! keys have serial number on them and cap has serial number on it they did not match! next time i will go to a store and buy it to make sure they keys are the rite ones!!!
__label__2 Western story: Westerns are my husband's favorites. He liked it very much, but I thought it was OK. We received it quickly and it was in very good shape.
__label__1 A boring story in N.Orleans: The most boring story I ever read, The story of a crazy woman his sex maniac sister and the ape of her husband. All is surrounded by the tipical sexim of William's plays. Don't waste your money
__label__1 BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!: I had to read this book for school. I do not recommend it to anyone. Boring, Boring, Boring, Boring. That sums it up. Blanche is out of her mind. Stanley is just mean and cold. Stella doesn't see the true colors of Stanley or Blanche. Boring, Boring, Boring, Boring
__label__1 Beware: These chairs look good in the picture, but are very flimsy & cheap in person. We ordered 2 of them 3 weeks ago, and one is already falling apart. We would send them back, but we've already thrown out the boxes they came in. Save your money!
__label__1 Safety questionable: I'm returning this car seat. After only using it twice, the belt clip pulled right out when I went to clip my child into the seat. I was disconcerted when it came out so easily and wondered how easily it might come out in an actual car accident. The manual tells you how to re-insert it, but the model I bought only has one slot for it, so there is no reason to make it easy to pull out (since it isn't adjustable with multiple slots for different sized kids). I'm not taking my chances on this seat...
__label__2 decent for life: this product is good, haven't had any concern or problem with yet.latching it to the car is alright since my car is decent one/
__label__2 Just fine: This is not a very pricey car seat but I think it's just fine. We have bought more expensive and presumeably safer cars seats, but with twins and the need to have 4 seats, I got this one because it was lightweight and could be used more for in and out of my husband's car and family members that might take the babies. God forbid we should ever be in an accident and have to really test them out, but they seem safe and sturdy enough for older babies.
__label__2 Great toddler and boster: We got this soon after our first grew out of the regular toddler seat. I found this easy to use and buckle. We love it. It easily converted to a booster seat too.
__label__2 Can't beat the price!: We bought 2 of these for Christmas gifts. I wouldn't have paid $40 for them but they were an excellent bargain at $10 each. I should have bought one for myself.
__label__2 Tragic fall of a family: Bernice Rubens' novels are difficult to find here in America but are definitely worth reading.The Elected Member is about the Zweck family, a well-to-do Orthodox Jewish family in England, and how it slowly disintegrated because of their firm hold onto their culture. The novel centers on the eldest son Norman who once was a top lawyer, but had to be admitted to a mental instituion after suffering a nervous breakdown. But what causes his breakdown? Was it his parents who simply hold onto him too tightly? His 2 sisters whom he committed crimes of the heart against? Rubens expertly transport us to the Zwecks' family past and slowly reveals how past mistakes can come back to haunt everyone in a family.
__label__2 PTCB Exam Review: I train pharmacy technicians, and this is the best, most concise review book I have seen. Almost everything on the test is covered here.
__label__1 It made no sense: I should have looked before I checked out this book. there were no pics and some of the rhymes didn't. I was disappointed. I felt I wasted my monthly book.
__label__2 Beautiful and inspiring: I love all Henri Nouwen's writing, but this is one of his greatest works. It breaks open the real meaning of Eucharist better than any other work I have read, for the ordinary lay person. The book itself is very high quality with beautiful illustrations. It makes a great gift (I have given away many copies). Put this by your bedside and you will find yourself going back to it again and again.
__label__2 With Burning Hears Review: This is a great meditation on the Euchar5ist and its application to everyday life. I highly recommend it to believers (and others?)Ray Jorgensen
__label__2 Best crochet book ever!: I taught myself how to crochet and this book answered the questions that I had. All the other books I have never explain certain things (like where to stick your hook in your chain row). It also contains alot of patturns I actually want to use rather than 1 or 2 in other books.
__label__1 Mediocre at best: Happy Hooker is neither a book about a hooker or how to crochet. This is less than mediocre - try Vogue Knitting on the Go: Crochet Basics (Vogue Knitting On The Go).
__label__1 Errors and more errors: I was so excited to get this book. I wanted to make almost everything in this book because it was all so cute. However, I couldn't get the patterns to work. I looked up the "errata" page on the book's website, and it still didn't work. There are so many errors in this book that I can only successfully complete one pattern (for the granny square afghan). I loved the driving gloves, but the pattern is so incorrect, I never could finish them.I do not know if EVERY pattern has errors. The problem is that I don't trust the patterns to be correct, and I'm not experienced enough to figure out if they are correct just by looking at them. Perhaps if you are a true expert in crochet, you can figure out how to fix the pattern problems on your own. However, this book just sits on my shelf unused, because I'm not going to buy the yarn and spend hours working on a project I can't finish.
__label__1 Please.....: Come on....the number of errors.I made the capelet twice, even though the ending stitch count wasn't what it should have been due to the pattern error. An intermediate crocheter would simply know to make increases (or decreases if appropriate) and move along. A beginner may just be frustrated when it doesn't turn out as it should.Then there was the beanie pattern that I basically "winged" and made from memorizing other beanies that I'd made before.The fashions are cute and inspiring but very basic and can probably be found for free on the internet.
__label__1 Lives in denial: Having read most books on Krishnamurti, I would give this book only two stars. Lutyens decided not to disclose the extent of the personal relationship even though by her own admission she knew about it from Krishnamurti himself. To that extent Sloss is accurate. However, Sloss is living in complete denial by not acknowledging either the culpability of her father who was a court established embezzler of public funds, not to mention her mother who was a married woman at the time she began her relationship with Krishnamurti. There are some other allegations against Krishnamurti as well but the lack of any objective evidence indicates they are likely a projection of personal bitterness. Sloss has certainly not helped her credibility by waiting for several years after Krishnamurti's death to go public with her version of events that took place many decades earlier.
__label__1 Warning will not play: WARNING....be careful of buying this unless you have a HD DVD. Too bad I bought this DVD as none of my players can view it and can not return it.
__label__2 Fantasia Amazia: Fantasia always has a great product and once again they deliver. These pencils are superb and sturdy. Great for the half hazard artist whose product ends up all around them. These pencils crashed to the floor often and were not affected (Note: I do not recommend dropping ANY colored pencil)
__label__1 not what you think: First off this helmet is enormous, even in a medium. It is the right size for my head and fits ok but I might as well flip it upside down because is sits on the top of my head and doesn't really go on or around it. There is so much padding inside it that it does not even slide halfway down your head. Obviously a knock off with the materials used. I don't understand why there are so many good reviews! The chrome looks nice but it's so easily corrupted that I scratched it with my fingernails trying to get the stickers off of it. I can understand that in order for it to be DOT approved that it should include a lot of padding but the only way this helmet would be safe is if you fell straight down from the sky onto your head. I am definitely returning this helmet despite having to pay for shipping both ways. I will up my rating review if the refund goes smoothly.
__label__1 One Star for Amazon!: All the stars in the heavens for Mozart's Zauberflote, of course. But there seems to be a bizarre confusion on this product page and in the reviews that follow it. The two editorial review MUST refer to different books. Several of the reviews suggest that they concern a children's retelling of the Magic Flute story, in English with illustrations. Is this a full musical score with the libretto in German (without translation, as another reviewer complains) or a story book for children? Your guess is as good as mine, but I wouldn't buy it on guesswork.
__label__2 Good Clean Show: My daughter requested these for Christmas. She watches them over and over. This is a good clean show for teenagers. Highly recommend.
__label__2 "Fellini-esque" Tradtional Brass Band Gets Hip: Beautiful and irresistible brass band from Italy, fans of Tom Waits would love it, has a very similar feel to some of his work - nicely orchestrated, moody dirges.Track one features guest vocals by Dani "El Mono Loco" Carbonell, of Macaco and Ojos de Brujo. Other vocalists appear and they are great too. Mostly an instrumental album though.
__label__2 Easy reading, informative, a good starting point for anyone.: This is a 123 page book that's quick and very thought provoking. The message is very simple. Just meditate and listen to the God force that's universal in all of us. Here's a small quote from the book, "It's easier to help a person who knows nothing than a wise man who knows all. Betty is very common sense in this book. She's selling no magic you don't already own. Buy two and give one to a friend.
__label__2 Carry Me Across The Mountain: Dan Tyminski's CD Carry Me Across The Mountain is cool and on the cover of the CD is Dan Tyminski playing the F - Style Nandolin.
__label__2 I COULDN'T PUT THIS ONE DOWN!: This book is 500 pages long and I read it in 5 days. Putting the book down was impossible and I took it wherever I went. Even though the book is kind of a copy from LORD OF THE RINGS it still will get you hooked. I recommend this book for ages 11 to adult. Interesting turns are always happening to the characters. If you can live through the semi-boring first 40-50 pages you will love this book.
__label__2 My favorite book!: Don't listen to the people who are giving this 1's and 2's. This is the best book i have ever read! If you like fantasy books you definately have to read this!
__label__2 adam s31: I thought eragon was one of the best books i have ever read the best part had to be the end. I am deffintly reading Eldest and the rest of the series
__label__1 "I love you, little one": Overuse, and improper use, of language - no starsBoring, one dimensional characters - no starsBoring one dimensional and repetitive plot devices - no starsAbsence of originality, but the weyrcat pretty cool anyway - one starBrom/Eragon relationship okay - one starEragon/Arya relationship (with yucky adolescent wet dreams) - MINUS one star.Getting me to read The Eye of the Wheel - 3 starsHaving my husband leave me annoying voice mail in a deep raspy voice saying "I love you little one" - 5 starsAnd that adds up to one star. No Paolini in my future.
__label__2 ADVENTURE MAGIC AND ENCHANTMENT!: I loved it!!!!!!! I begged my Mom, I screamed, I threw a temper tantrum for her to read more every night because I wanted to know what was going to happen next! (just kidding- no temper tantrums- but I did beg) It's filled with cliff-hangers that make you need to know more.It's sad and somebody important dies. I have to confess that it has been done before, there were alot of things similar from other books. Like somebody important dies in Harry Potter too. But still, it is done in an original way. Christopher Paolini has his own unique attitude and stlye.I can't wait to see what will happen in the Eldest. There is a red dragon on the cover, not blue. And this book left me wanting to read more in the trilogy.
__label__1 I think I've read this before.: Wow. I've never seen so much "borrowing" done. It's amazing!In my opinion, this should not be allowed to happen, but evidently I must be in the minority. Perhaps most people are not so well read as I and think that this book is in some way original. In my opinion, it is in no way original. There are borrowings from every major work of fantasy and most minor ones. It's really distracting as you attempt to read. This is one of the few books that I have started and could just not continue with. It was truely horrid. Wonderful beginners work, I guess and great for a seventeen year old, but why publish it?
__label__1 horrible: One of the worst books I have ever read. Ever! I forced myself to read it only because it was a gift, but honestly it's not worth the paper it was printed on. I wish I had those hours of my life back, I totally regret reading it.The characters are flat and have only one demension. The names are either copied from better books, impossible to pronounce or complete cheese. Through out the whole book you feel bad for the characters because the dialog is so bad.I've read better work by 14 year old class mates!
__label__2 Good read, despite the elitest raving: I read this book in two days at work...I liked it very much, though I did find that it had many common elements of other fiction. What doesn't? Everyone should know, there is never anything that is original now! Everything is a copy and it can be easily argued...The people raving about how bad this book is are simply elitist. They have had favorites in the past and are acting like they are rouge scholars and this book isn't worth there VERY valuable time. They are full of it! I say...Congratulations kid; I look forward to reading on and finding out what happens to our young hero.
__label__1 Cute story but its been done: While I applaud the kid's efforts and see a fine writing future for him, I must point out that this book is a regurgitation of every other major fantasy series to date. If it were not in fact his parent's publishing company I doubt he would have been published. The story itself is cute, but the writer is young and needs many more years of polishing before he can reach the standards of those authors he's parroting in this book. It's quite sad that there is nothing new in this book. I had hoped for better.
__label__1 Bland.: The kind of repetetive, banal, Tolkien-referrenced nonsense that gives fantasy a bad name. Loved by pre-teens, juveniles, and neophytes to the genre. Not a bad introduction to fantasy if you are young, but definitely uninteresting to an adult reader.
__label__1 Rip Off: This book was The Dragonriders, LOTR, and HArry Potter in one. Even the names arent original, the Hero of destiny: LOTR, Aragorn, Eragon, Eragon, the Elf mistresss, LOTR, Arwen, Eragon, Arya, the evil foot soldiers: LOTR: Uruks/Orcs, Eragon, Urguls: The Wizard: LOTR, Gandalf, Eragon,Brom, The evil speacalist: LOTR, Nazgul, Eragon, Rozack, LOTR: Mordor, Eragon: Morzan, the list goes on and on. The character development is the same, and the nations are exact: both have dwarves who have shut themselves from the world, and a love story between a man and an elf, shaky alliances between the evil foot soldiers and the evil empire. And the spells all resemble that of Harry Potter. This book is ok but if u want a real adventure story thats original read all of Tolkiens books.
__label__1 If their was a -5 Star... I would choose it..: I definitley give 'Eragon' a -5* star. I would if it were an option.Some well known 'funnies' to eragon1. Aria and Eragon will probably turn out to be brother and sister.2. Eragon is mad at Murtagh for being not 'merciful' enough, and later in the book is happy that murtaggh is such a 'merciless' fighter.3. Guess what story this is: A boy and an older man go off for an adventure! Nope! YOUR WRONG! Its not star wars!4. Aragorn and Arwen, Eragon and Aria? Call me crazy.. but they sound familar...I'm sorry I wasted 3 hours reading this book
__label__2 Five stars doesnt even do it enough justice.: FANTASTIC!! AMAZINGLY THRILLING!! Paolini deserves an A+! very original, action packed, and all out cool, this book is defenatly a best seller!! by the way,Saphira was so well developed, I pictured the perfect dragon in my mind. NO young author can out-write this master of the English language!
__label__2 An Awesome Read!!!: Eragon is an awesome read for people of all ages, ecspecially those who enjoy fantasy. Eragon has managed to hold my attention better than many fantasy books including the Lord of the Rings series. It's a fantastic story about a boy that enters the ranks of the legendary "Dragon Riders". I don't want to give too much away so honestly if you have a chance read Eragon it's incredible. Just one warning start early in the evening, if you don't you'll find it's well past midnight before you manage to find a good place to leave off.
__label__1 it's not worth reading: There are a lot of one and two star reviews about Eragon. They seem to fall into 3 categories:1. The fantasy fans who have read other fantasy books or watched fantasy movies and therefore know that Eragon is a rip-off and they are not happy about it.2. The people who know something about good writing and therefore know how badly written Eragon is and they are not happy about it.3. The people who think the book is boring and predictable and can't finish it.Personally, I didn't like it because the female characters in Eragon are a joke. Well, all the characters are, but especially the females.I think if you buy it you'll probably regret it. Take it out from the library and see what you think because it's quite possible you'll hate it.
__label__1 ewww!: This was one of the worst books I have ever read. The plot was quite interesting, but the way it was wrtitten was horrible. It dragged on and on about unimportant topics and was extremely boring. The action started around the two hundreth page. I would definitly not recomend this book.
__label__1 I don't care how young the author was at the time...: It's sad that so much of the hullabaloo over this book comes from the fact that the author was a teenager when he wrote it. That's all well and good and impressive, but that does not mean the book is super. I'm sorry, but when I read it, I did not think about how old the author was and take that into consideration.The fact is that this is a so-so fantasy that follows the lines of so many other so-so fantasies without doing anything the least bit original.The characters are flat, the pacing is horrid, and someone needed to rip the thesaurus from little Paolini's hands. No one needs that many adjectives per sentence!Painfully generic and nothing at all special.
__label__2 Great audio theater!: I had already read the book and the Eldest book before purchasing this set. It is an excellent quality audio book. It amazes me that one man did so many different voices. He is an excellent actor. The dragon's voice sounded funny to me at first, but now I can't believe they will use a women for the voice in the movie. Dragons are big creatures with big voices.A few friends have listened to the CDs because they didn't want to read it all before the December 15th movie is released. They loved it too and the Eldest CDs. Audio books done well can be a great way to experience a story. I have purchased other audio books that basically just read the book aloud. This was acting. Its worth the money. We have enjoyed listening to it at least 3 times since it was purchased.
__label__1 "I WAS FORCED TO READ THIS BOOK AT GUNPOINT BY FAN-BOY TERRORISTS!": [...]When I was in grade school I could remember the corny holiday card making projects. Those with no originality, which were the majority of kids in school, sprinkled glitter and crappily and happily glued little bows on the card. Those few who rebelled and wanted to differ from the class herd, drew Santa on fire or added some far different materials on it. The point of the metaphor is,Yeah, you love/like Eragon, not so much because it is your genuine preference, but because you do not want to differ from the class herd. That and you probably lack a basic reading in significant literature. But hey, if this author can sell-out and sell his books out, more power to him. You have a right to your opinion. But that doesn't make this book read any less like hackneyed cardboard fantasy prose...it still does.
__label__2 Eragon: Have you ever been in a place where Riders and Dragons Rule? The book I'm writing this review about is Eragon, by Christopher Paolini. The book takes place around the medevil ages in the 1600's in early Europe. I would classify the genere of this book as fantasy and adventure because of the dragons and the long journeys. The story is about a young boy named Eragon, who finds a blue stone that's really a dragon egg. Eragon has to battle to save a kingdom with his dragon, Saphira against dark enemies. There is a sequal to Eragon called Eldest and there is currently a movie out based on this book. I like this book because it makes you think about what is happening because the writing is descriptive. I think Eragon is appropriate for middle school and high school students because of the difficult vocabulary. You should read Eragon because it challenges you to believe that what is happening to Eragon is real!
__label__1 Childish and too unoriginal: The amazing thing about this book was that it was written by a 15 year old. But the bad thing is that it was horrible. The charactors were so much like LOTR. I felt like this book was too slow paced and lacked action. It also had a very loose story line and lacked any epic feeling. I also felt that is was hard to love the charectors. They all(old or young) had the heart of a 15 year old. Brom,the old wise rider, lacked the wiseness that charectors such as Gandalf had. Overall I hated this book and i dont intend on reading the rest of the series.
__label__1 I've read it all before: I've been a bibliophile since I was about six years old, and this is the first and only book that I have ever thrown onto the floor in disgust. From the poor orphaned farm boy who gets swept up into an exciting adventure, to the completely predictable dragons, dwarves and elves, to the Star Wars-esque evil empire and resitance movement, to the appearance of the white bearded wizardly mentor (tm), it seems as if every single stale fantasy cliche gets trotted out and pressed into service. This is a book composed of stock characters and overused plot points in an entirely typical and unimaginative pseudo-medieval fantasy setting. Anyone looking for a good YA fantasy novel would probably be better off with something by Diana Wynne Jones, Garth Nix, Tamora Pierce, Phillip Pullman, J.K. Rowling, Holly Black, Monica Furlong, Susan Cooper, or any of the many other writers out there who have come up with vastly better books for younger fantasy fans.
__label__2 Some southern girl,: Ok i gotta say Christopher's(chris) book Eragon may have given away future plots in the story but you always had to guess when they came.i mean don't you people think it's nice to know how things work?and yes you may be able to tell he was real young when wrote Eragon but for some fantasy books that i've read by 40 year old people Eragon had way way more action.and about the whole crying thing,if you acctually read the book you would understand that Eragon had alot of pain in his life and to top it all off it was all happing at the same time.First with people he loved dieing, and losing good friends for a while.come on people show some sympathy.so to conclude my review I give it a two thumbs up,Chris could have done a little better but that's what practice is for right?But if this goes against what you think DEAL WITH IT!
__label__2 Almost Amazing: The story of Eragon has all the makings of being one of the best fantasy books I have ever read. It only falls a little short during the few passages and plot lines that seem forced and don't allow you to get completely sucked into the book. Overall its worth reading.
__label__1 Obviously writen by a 15 year old: This book may have a good plot line, but by chapter three I began dreading picking this book up to read each night. I picked this book up because I am an imense Harry Potter and Artemis Fowl fan. I was very disapointed.The subject (and typically the first word) of every sentance in this book is a proper noun. Trying to keep track of the he, she, they and its quickly became annoying. Also, the author can't mention any inatomate object without giving you several long metaphores or symolies to describe it.This book reads as though it was writin by someone who has never heard of any literay devices other than symolies and metaphores and believes writing a good story means cramming as many of them into it as humanly possible. Sometimes less is more.
__label__2 Eragon Book Review: This book was wonderfully imaginative and captivating. It contains all the elements that a fantasy reader could want and more. The action, emotional features, and the bonds of friendship are so clearly shown that it is nearly impossible for a person not to get caught up in it all.Christopher Paolini brings out the hero in his brave, yet young, character, Eragon. Paolini shows us how destiny controls our lives and that we have to accept who we are, no matter how much we wish otherwise. In the end, we may have bigger plans made for us in our lives than we ever could have made for ourselves. Christopher Paolini, my thanks for the wonderful journey!
__label__2 I Love this Book!: Wow! This was a great book. I anticipate the rest of the trilogy. I'm a fan of Pern and when Anne McCaffery had rave reviews of Eragon, I had to buy it. I have not been disappointed. I highly recommend this book and intend to have my 9 year old son read it starting this weekend! I am normally a very slow reader but I was finished with this tome in less than 4 days, something of a record for me! My congratulations to Mr. Paolini! I can hardly wait for more!
__label__1 Hmmm: This is alright for a beginner but, I hope his next book improves greatly, otherwise I will not even bother to read the third one.One thing that bugs me about this book is that the author seemed to keep changing his mind about almost everything! For instance, his dragon. She keeps almost changing shape! She's supposed to be so huge and strong but can't carry three people. She flies way up in the air one day, but the next day she can't breathe that high. It makes no sense. Its as if the author keeps switching from one story to another.I don't think it was written well.
__label__2 A knockoff--yeah, but I liked it!: Ok, so its obvious Paolini was a Tolkien fan, and his descriptions of elves and dwarves come right out of middle earth, but I couldn't help it, I liked his story. As it progressed, I found myself checking his map and seeing exactly where his characters where and where they were going and I was hooked. Although I could tell a teenager, albeit a talented one, wrote this book, I thought Paolini's writing and plot got more polished the more I got into it. I'll be reading the next one for sure, and I'm not even a kid, just a middle aged housewife. I am sure any young reader would love this story!
__label__1 Cliched, derivative, passable: Eragon is a fantasy novel written by Christopher Paolini. He started when he was fifteen, and finished when he was nineteen, which is truly a noteworthy accomplishment. This book has been hailed as a phenomenon, and has become an international bestseller. But honestly, I wrack my brain trying to understand how and why. For those who have read and love Eragon, I hope you become exposed to real fantasy and science fiction soon. For those of you who haven't read this, let me make a suggestion: read Lord of the Rings, and watch the original Star Wars trilogy. You'll know all you need to know about Eragon, and you'll save your money.
__label__1 Needs works: I picked up this book based on some of the hype generated around Paolini. While I have to agree with some of the other reviews regarding the writing style and the portions of the story which are influenced from some very geat Authors. Even though Paolini has taken plot lines from other Authors I will wait to see where these stories end up. I don't want to trash his first effort completely and look forward to seeing what the next volume has in store. Hopefully, the editing issues can be resolved by then.
__label__1 Not too great: this book is a major acomplishment for a 15-16 year old, but so much stuff is ripped off of LOTR. It's really predictable and you can see what will happen chapters early if you are 13+ years old. what really bugs me is that Paolini describes EVERY SINGLE THING in the book. i mean, do we really NEED to know what all the unimportant characters look like with so much choppy detail??? also, sometimes the characters speak like it's Middle Earth, and sometimes they speak like it's Today.
__label__2 great book @#$% the bad reviews: the inheritence series is a great series to read. i loved every word in it. Also read the next 3 books
__label__1 A REAL STINKER: Eragon is a total joke. I'm like the only one I know who finished it. Most of my friends tossed theirs. Does any character do anything it makes sense on it? Stupid. Stupid. Stupid. Stupid. Stupid. Stupid.
__label__1 Borderline Plagiaristic: Eragon is a fluffy version of Lord of the Rings or the Wheel of Time. It shouldn't have been published.I recommend reading The Golden Compass by Philip Pullman instead of Eragon. It is much deeper and much more original.
__label__1 Had he been much older, I doubt this would have been published.: Sure, it's good for a 17-year-old, but that doesn't make it good literature. I think I've seen fan fiction better than this.So many elements of the plot, locations, even names are almost shamelessly derived from other works of fantasy, such as 'The Lord of the Rings' and 'Star Wars'. I read this in 6th grade and, of course, loved it. Now I've gone back, re-read it, and it's almost painful, how so much of this over praised purple brick is clearly written by a kid. It's good for a 17-year-old, sure, but to me, that doesn't save it from being mediocre.Nonetheless, if he keeps this up, Paolini shows great promise at an older age. But for now, I'd much rather read Philip Pullman's 'His Dark Materials', or anything by Tolkein,instead this overrated purple brick of a fantasy novel. Kids will probably love it, but anyone older will probably be able to see through it.
__label__1 I Could Write A Better Book: The only thing that grabs any attention to the "Inheritance" series is that Paolini is only 17. If the exact same book was written by a 40-year-old, the book would have sold about 50 copies. The book is completely a ripoff of good sci-fi stories and the plot makes no sense. No sense whatsoever. Do us all a favor and buy a Get Fuzzy comic book. PEACE OUT!LOCAL CRAZY MONKEY
__label__2 Best fantasy book ever: Despite what other people have said about this book, it is most likely the best fantasy book that I have EVER read! The people that complained about his language and choice of words obviously didn't read the book that I read. His vocabulary in this book was OUTSTANDING! I can't believe that he is only 19! And, just because he knows to use other words besides 'said' doesn't make the book tacky!!!!! I think that its awesome that he uses rich vocab. Many books written by accomplished authors don't even write as well as this man did!!! I can't believe that people could criticize a book and dislike it just because he has wonderful vocabulary in this book. The people whom criticized it probably are just upset and jealous because they didn't know what the words meant and don't have that good of a vocabulary. This book is awesome with a deep plot, developed characters, and tense battles. Read it!!!!!!!!!!!
__label__2 Fun read.: This book was a fun read. There are times that you can tell that the writer was in his mid to late teens when he wrote it, and other times that he writes far beyond what you would expect from someone his age. Excellent read that I would recommend to any fan of this genre.
__label__2 Very Entertaining: I enjoyed this book quite a bit. While it is a bit derivative, the way it was written is entertaining and there are enough original components to keep you interested.
__label__1 Boring and bad writing: All I can say is that i couldnt get through it. Poorly written and rather boring. I love a good fantasy book and there are many good ones out there that others have listed. Don't bother with this one
__label__1 Save Your $ For Something Worth While: Like so many others I wasn't going to comment on either of these books but some of the recent reviews pleading with people to read it makes me sick. Begging people to read this? DO read the reviews however AND DO read them with a grain of salt the good obviously are there to promot the book,but many of the not so good reviews are there to promote it too. Don't fall for this and waste money lining this author's pockets. I rate this as NEGATIVE -5 star! Don't buy this book! You are better off without it.
__label__1 don't leave me hanging: I just could not get this book. I was so confused with this made up language and the the main character drove me nuts! Is he this great dragon rider who can use magic, or is he a pouty teenager from the 21st century.When I got to the end I was so upset because I felt that there was so much that has been left unanswered. I felt that I was left hanging with some important issues, such as Eragons parents. It seemed to me that at the begining of the book he cared a great deal with wanting to know about his parents, especially his dad. But when it was discussed later on in the book Eragon never tried to find out any information. Especially when the character Brom talked about his mother and the fact that he knew her. Which led me to come up with my own speculation of...was Brom his father? Who knows because nothing was revealed.
__label__2 Copy-cat: Overall I thought Eragon was a pretty good book. I liked the way Paolini described the land, people, and dragons. Although, he needs to learn to be more original. I can see getting your inspiration from a book (The Lord of the Rings) but this is just taking it too far. Paolini is obviously talented so he should use his talent and creat something of his own!Eragon needs to stop being so inquisitive. Some of his questions that are needed to describe things could be answered through the story instead of by the characters. The story has an okay plot line and I am eager to see where it takes Eragon. But advice for Paolini on future books, use your imagination and do something original! It's easy to imitate other books but it takes talent to come up with something new.
__label__2 Exquisite and Riveting: When I had first heard of the book, I thought it would be a ridiculously confusing science fiction fantasy book that was not worth the trouble of reading. However, I gave in and checked it out form the library after my curiousity rose when I saw its unpublished sequel being sold on amazon. I am very glad I did. Eragon staisfied my appetite for a good, decent, and understandable story about dragons, and Eragon and Saphira. I enjoyed the plot development and the creativity Paolini put into making the story and its world seem real and fascinating. I wait patiently and curiously for the second book of the trilogy, Eldest, which I hope will be as good or exceed Eragon. Loved it and recommend it to all fantasy-genre lovers. Enjoy!
__label__1 boring and, well, boring.: I believe that my title says it all but I will add a little more. If you have read this book you might have noticed that the main charactor, Eragon, is knocked out during all but one battle scene. From this I conclude that the author is a wimp and is too frightened to write out the details of a battle. Don't read this book and read the Tolkien books instead.
__label__1 Not even close to the hype: Poorly written cross of Pern, Middle Earth, and all the rest. You'll find yourself stumbling over tedious descriptions and unneccessary dialog tags trying to read a story that you feel you're read before... This is, quite frankly, the kind of writing you find in online fan fiction.
__label__2 Eragon: I got an ARC of the upcoming Random House release of Eragon at the BEA in Los Angeles; read the book on the way home. Out of curiosity I got a copy of the self-pubbed book to read and compare. I loved both! I wish the best of success to the young man.The Random House reps are spreading this review of Eragon to the trade: "Full praise to Eragon and I want more! A winner ... tip of the hat to young master Paolini."--Anne McCaffrey
__label__1 Don't let the rave reviews fool you!: Like many, our family bought this book and the next based on the glowing reviews of the many readers. Unfortunately, we were in for quite a shock as these are the most unimaginative, poorly written books ever published. At Borders where I returned all four books we purchased (2 copies of Eragon and 2 of Eldest), there was a pile of returned copies of Eldest behind the counter. I was in fact unable to get a refund, instead I got store credit on a gift card.Eragon is an uninspiring story chock full of tired, overused characters. The prose is unimaginative, very wordy, and fails miserably on all levels. Each characters talks just like every other character. I don't know why everyone said this book was so good. My kids are in tears. Thanks a lot Chris Paolini for ruining our last week of summer break!
__label__1 Two things: Eragon has two things going for it:1) The cover. Come on, ya gotta admit that it's pretty, right?2) The plural of "Galbatorix" is "Galbatorices".
__label__2 A Kid's Review - Awesome Book!: I'm 9 years old and I really don't like to read very much but my mom suggested i should read this book. I started reading it and loved it. Eragon is an awesome book and i think everyone who likes action-packed fantasy books should read it. its about a teenage boy who finds a dragon egg and raises it to be a powerful beast. Together they go on a journey to fight the evil king Galbatorixs.This book is 497 pages of fun. I can't wait to read the next one!
__label__1 Yuck!: Shallow characters, uninteresting story, and an unoriginal fantasy land fail to sate my sense of wonder. It's like so many previous reviewers said, its all been done before and Chris has just stapled all these mediocre fantasy staples into one humdrum conglomerate of nothingness. Kind of what Stephen King did in the Dark Tower (Adams,Baum) only at least King can write!!!!!!!!!Anyway don't bother with this steaming pile of sentence fragments and embellished adverbs. If you want a GOOD young adults fantasy saga check out Philip Athans "His Dark Materials", contrary to this you WONT be disappointed
__label__1 You Can Run But You Can't Hide: This book is a rip off the famous Star Wars Saga. I cant stand it. It also borrows a few ideas from the Dragon Riders of Pern and Lord of the Rings. It may have been an enjoyable read but still pathetic.
__label__2 excellent effort: Having written fiction since I was 7 (that's 80 years ago), I am impressed by what this young man has achieved. It's not great literature, nor even particularly original, but it's an excellent start. I couldn't have done as well at his age; and I'm a dam' good writer.
__label__1 not great, but not terrible: Ok it was pretty derivative, although I admit I never clued in on the Star Wars similarities until I read some reviews. And the writing was pretty pedestrian. But I did enjoy it and that has to count for something. A good introduction to the genre for young readers? yeah I think so.
__label__2 An entertaining read: Is it the same world that others made up? Yes, that's true. There's little originality in Eragon's universe.Is the prose below the level of Tolkien? Obviously. It is on par with Robert Jordan, which I think is decent enough, as Eragon is merely another fantasy novel and not an epic work.Is the plot completely and utterly predictable? It is so predictable that the complete plotline of the entire trilogy is spelled out in a fortune-telling early on.But is it entertaining? Yes!If you can settle for the penultimate.. if you can enjoy a book for its vividness and adventure, even if it wasn't written by an Oxford scholar... then you will love Eragon. It is not /Lord of the Rings/-- it is /Harry Potter/.
__label__2 Eragon is amazing: Eragon was looking for a deer to eat for his family. He tried to get the deer but he found an egg instead. He did not know what was inside of it. One day the egg hatched and a baby dragon came out. Then the dragon flew in the sky and turned into a big dragon. But then Eragon had to fight the darkness and kill the person who makes fire. Read this book to find out if the firemaster dies. This book is for eight-year-olds and up.
__label__1 Time for Credibility/Reality check??: The reason people claim to love this book is because it was supposedly written by a kid. Definitely time for some truth in martketing Knopf. Paolini is at this time 22 years old. If I do the math and go back 2 years that makes him 19 or 20 when Eragon was published. A 19 year old is not a kid. So why market this book as written by a kid? Only reason I can figure is since the book could not be sold otherwise. As for litery quality or merit this book has none. I didn't dislike it due to the fact it was derivative. I disliked it because it was contrived, poorly written, and lacking any redeeming quality. Parents before letting your kids read this think twice about the poor example being set.
__label__1 verbose!: This book is full of adverbs and adjectives and extremely verbose. Sounds amateurish. Lost my interest. Stick to established fantasy writers to get your money's worth from your reading.
__label__2 WOW!: A wonderful book full of fantasy and wonder. When you think you have the plot figured out it changes and changes again. Better than Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter in my opinion!
__label__1 Geez.............: As other reviewers have alredy stated, Eragon Does draw too much from other much better works of fantasy. What I noticed the most though, was how much was taken from David Edding's "Belgariad". The stories are so alike. Eragon is a farm boy, just like Garion. Eragon is an orphan, just like Garion. Eragon befriends a storyteller who turns out to be a sorcerer, Just like garion. Eragon does magic in the same way Garion does, through "The will and the word".I could go on and on. I think Paolini counted on the fact that most people haven't read Edding's masterpiece. One of the only resons his book sold so well was because he was so young when he started writing it.Also, the dialogue is stupid, and it is obvious that he tries to make his writing sound impressive through flowery writing style.
__label__1 I really wanted to like this book: Really, I wanted to like it. That's why I kept reading. But ultimately, an editor needed to sit him down and tell him to take it down a notch. Or two. It was soooo overwritten and totally unoriginal. I got the feeling that Paolini is used to everyone defering to his superior intellect and that nobody around him had the sense or the heart to tell him his book was crap. It took me days to plod through it.
__label__2 Good, but written by a teenager: This book was pretty good. It took a while to fully get into the story and I did not think the plot or action moved along enough, but am interested to see what happend to the cahracters in book 2. You can tell it was written by a teenager as some of the vocabulary, plot development, and character assessment were rather rudimentary. I did like how there were some new types of chracters introduced into the fantasy world, such as the werecat, But overall, it was worth the read.
__label__1 Even for a seventeen-year-old....: This is among the worst fantasy books I have ever read, and it infuriates me that it is getting so much attention. I could possibly forgive the utter lack of ingenuity of its plot or the language, which is more suited for a 7-year-old, if only I saw some signs of the author caring about the quality of his book. Unfortunately, it is obvious for the entire first third of the book that it was not even edited for basic grammar, and I find it insulting.
__label__1 wow...what a disgrace: oh my god. this novel makes me want to eat six lemons and call my mom to tell her i hate cats. this is not in any ways original. what is happening to childrens fiction these days.
__label__1 Meh ...: This book redefines derriviative. It seems like the sort of fan fiction where the writer goes in to other writers' worlds, kills their dragons, steals their gold, and makes out with their Arwen. This book makes a fine door-stop or paperweight, though (+1 star).
__label__1 Not impressed: The author makes many radical and unrealistic assumptions based on the Bible with not one reference or footnote, and no bibliography.
__label__2 Learn the lessons in the Bible: To be able to go through the entire Bible, verse by verse, chapter by chapter, book by book with such an amazing Bible teacher is such a blessing. Pastor Chuck clearly teaches topical lessons we can learn in the Bible, which were put there for us by God!
__label__1 The book was great, this movie not so much: Nowhere near as good as the book. Nothing like it. You might like the TV personalities though. Still love Deepak though. Smart man.
__label__2 Light, funny British Christmas fun: My kids and I really enjoy Creature Comforts. It is laid-back dry British Humor, the characters and voices together make the creatures endearing. Clean humor. It has no plot to speak of and no action. So if those are important to you, you might not like it.
__label__2 Positively hilarious: This has become one of my favorite annual Christmas viewings and the funniest of my very large library of Christmas specials. So original and creative, and so very hilarious. Good pickup for just about anybody.
__label__2 Creature Comforts Christmas: I really love this short movie, and I'm glad I could actually FIND it and for a great price. So, thanks a bunch!
__label__2 interesting: I found the book interesting enough to stay reading it. I was never bored with it. I am always looking for a good western!
__label__2 ANOTHER GREAT ADDITION TO THE COLLECTION !!!!!!: Not as magical and is darker than the first 3 movies. Overall it was a great movie!!!The ending leaves you anxious to see the next film!!!
__label__2 Harry Potter Movies are Outstanding!: The Harry Potter movies are great! My favorite is the Goblet of Fire. It has a lot of action in it other than the to be expected. It was closer to the book than I expected.
__label__2 great prices: I was very happy with this item! it was shipped quickly and it was still in the factory packaging just as promised. and the price was perfect! i watched it the day i got it.
__label__2 Harry Potter Rides Again: Another fine adaptation (though you get the sense that they could have added in more). The students are growing up, the stakes are getting higher, and this, of course, features the full return of Voldemort. And of course there's the character played by an actor doomed to play that infernal pasty white sparkly vampire in the years to come. Where's a Voldemort or Wormtail in those Twilight films when you really need a sparkly vampire dispatched anyway?
__label__1 Guilty: Drek in the First Degree: All of the Harry Potter movies (as well as the books) are artless adolescent, "no-rules" fantasy composed of pubescent cultural drek of interest only to those newly familiarizing themselves with incipient secretions of estrogen and testosterone. Mature adults, stay away unless you consider gagging and retching forms of entertainment.The most recent (...Goblet of Fire) is actually the worst - mostly for the length of time (2.5 hrs.) it takes to pass. Rawlings is no Tolkien, and director Newell provided no improvements. The special effects - especially flying - are too fast and furious to be appreciated as anything but blurs. If you must see this travesty, complete the experience with stale popcorn.
__label__1 Is this a bootleg copy?: I ordered this to replace a missing copy for our home collection. The HP movies are our favorites, and we watch them often. I loaned Goblet to someone, can't remember who, and it's been more than a year. I finally decided to admit it's not coming home, and ordering a new one. Unfortunatly, you get what you pay for here. I was excited to find a coopy for around five dollars (and didn't think twice about it, since Blue Ray is becoming popular, and it's an older movie now) but when we watched it last week, the DVD plays, but skips and catches every 10 minutes or so and the picture looks 'off'. I haven't bothered trying to replace it, since it was only a few dollars, but I will be looking for a real copy soon.
__label__1 Bait and Switch: Warner Bros. has shown us the dark side of the entertainment business by releasing this "Ultimate Edition" without the extended version. It's unfortunate they will still make money on these flawed editions from people who were pleased with the year one and year two sets(as was I), which included both the theatrical and extended films, who will feel compelled to keep this incomplete set (I will be returning mine). I encourage everyone who feels the same to write about it. Whether it's in these reviews, a blog or emails directly to Warner Bros., letting the powers that be know that their customers are dissatisfied is the only way they'll even consider terminating these shady business practices. The following link is to Warner Bros. Studios' online customer service: [...]
__label__2 Very Entertaining: I'm not certain that this edition is better than the dar kand disturbing Prisoner Of Azkaban, although it is solid entertainment in a sort of "potentially fatal" Olympics kind of way. The acting is improving with the maturity of the cast and The Goblet of Fire really brings this into the light. A must see film for fans of the series although perhaps not the best of the series.Fans of this Harry Potter type of fantasy also check out- Artemis Fowl or The Uncommon Adventures of Tucker O'Doyle
__label__1 Italian language available ?: Someone could tell about italian language on ultimate edition ?Thanks for helpHarry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Ultimate Edition) [Blu-ray]
__label__1 Not extended!: There is an extended version and this is not it. It is on television all the time. Clever of the WB to make the first two extended and not the next two. I assumed they were extended and bought them.
__label__1 What a dirty trick: Ran into Bestbuy today grabbed the first DVD of Potter I saw. Got home, it was one disc no special features. Why not just make one edition like with all the other Potter movies? What a dirty rotten trick pulled by Warner Brothers. (...)
__label__1 Betrayed: If you are a fan of the book do not watch this movie. They have turned what may be the best book of the series into an amusement park ride - all flash and no substance. As the books evolve J K Rowling has targeted an older and more mature audience. This movie targets the mindless.
__label__1 why a director is able to ruin an adventure of a lifetime: harry potter movies 1 and 2 and 3 are excelent.they cut, obviously, but the story was still a clear, presise message. then along comes a yodelin', rough backin' coyote to change everything the way he sees fit. heres just some of the loose ends left untied.why did neville go nuts by the cruciatus?how did crouch live, escape, attack moody,who killed crouch? where did the house elves go, when is fudge gonna call dumbledore mad? what about rita skeeter? or spew? and theres hardly any snape!at least the actors were good. daniel radcliffe, EMMA WATSON ,and rupert. but the director must think that because they call it harry potter, it cant be about any one else. i quote: 'harry potter and the goblet of fire is about HARRY POTTER, and THE GOBLET OF FIRE. PERIOD!'
__label__1 Good job, geniuses.: Okay, everyone who's given this movie a good review and critiqued the rest of us for comparing it to the movie, is not too bright.What you fail to realize, is that the movie doesn't form a coherent plot, unless you've read the fourth book. So, the book fails on two fronts. As a movie, it isn't coherent enough to be considered good. Too much time is spent on things that aren't crucial, while crucial events are extremely undercovered (see Chapters 1-12).As a movie replicating a book, it miserably fails. All can agree.1 Star. Next time, pick a side, and stick to it.
__label__1 Enough Chumps Will Buy It Anyway: Goblet of Fire, the movie, is an unacceptable hash. Sure, the original is a long book. Did the mercenaries running this franchise think perhaps to make it into two movies and sell them both? I understand that a film adaptation of a novel is an adaptation, not a copy in another medium, but it must still be a finished work in its own right. GOFtm is so disjoint and illogical and the progress through it so unmotivated that a fair amount of what happens in it makes no sense. It would be a complete waste of money even if the book did not exist. This is not a film but an insult. Slapdash, haphazard, chopped up exploitation. The cinematic equivalent of a Barbie doll.
__label__2 Very cool book!: Beautiful book. Cover and art are incredible. Very proud to display in home. This is a great, quick read and this edition is very nice.
__label__2 Greatest author: This novel is one of the best ever written by the greatest author ever. I first read this book when I was in third grade, and still love it five years later. This story was the first to get me into the fantasy genre and it has truly been a marvelous journey ever since. To anyone who enjoys a good story, read this tale of elves, dwarves, dragons, trolls, hobbits, and wizards. Also, if you choose to read this novel, don't forget to read the even better Lord of the Rings Trilogy by the same author. Remember to read this first, however. Don't listen to the other reviews which state that this book is a load of hogwash. It is, in fact, a wonderful adventure that a reader will never forget.
__label__1 cheesy/boring: sometimes when i was reading this i just feel like why am i reding this?? people told me that its a goodbut technically it makes no sense at all. its not tht great honestly.
__label__2 There and back again, a Hobbit's tale, by Bilbo Baggins: This is the story of Bilbo Baggins, a Hobbit, of Bag End, Under Hill, Hobbiton. The story tells of how Bilbo came to be involved in the dwarves mission to travel to The Lonely Mountain, defeat Smaug (the dragon) and retrieve their treasures and their homeland. It's a great tale of survival through untold hardships, when all seems to have failed, and yet, a little luck, and a little perseverance sees them through.The Hobbit is a great introduction into Tolkein's world and a great set up for the Lord Of The Rings. I highly recommend it.
__label__2 nicely done: this audiobook is a good. i was looking for a good audiobook where where i can relax and listen to. well, i found it. a very good renbition of the hobbit. buy it
__label__1 What a HORRIBLE book.: I just don't see how everyone loves this book. It is a *never ending* tale of Bilbo Baggins and his 'journey' with the wizard and dwarves. J.R.R. Tolkien is a quite horrible writer...the story goes on and on and on, continuing with them hiding in a cave, fighting a dragon, or another thing of that sort. I am a pre-teenager and I still cannot focus on it because of its pure stupidity.
__label__1 Well this book wins the award for the most boring, stupid &: This book had way to many characters! Is boring from start to end and has no point! What the hell does this book mean?
__label__2 Deluxe Pocket Edition: I own many copies of the Hobbit to include the audio and ebook. This is a perfect travel version and read it often. Font size is perfect for me and the maps in the cover are great for quick reference. I have noticed a large number of one star reviews for this product that have nothing to do with it with most being either the Kindle version or the audiobook. Take heed when you look at the reviews.
__label__2 All time favorite: This is a classic that can be read over and over. Good for reading aloud to the kids on trips too.
__label__2 I loved it again!: I have several ragged copies of this here and there in and out of boxes. I don't have to hunt any more. It'll always be on my Kindle.
__label__1 The hobit: The book is about a young hobit that goes on an adventurer to get rid of a ring that if you w where it you turn e ebook
__label__1 How do you keep an idiot busy for hours?: If you have some extra time on your and feel like pissing it away, then read this book. I love literature;however, I cannot believe I wasted valuable hours of my life on reading this so called book. I've read technical manuals that are more interesting. If there is someone you really don't like, suggest that they read this book.
__label__1 the stupidest book i have ever read!: i thought this book was the dumbest book i have read in a long time. i hated it. i found it very hard to get into with all the characters listed in it. i would give it 0 stars if i could.
__label__2 Amazing:): I have read this book several times and it seems to get better each time! I love this story! Very different tone than the Lord of the Rings, after learning more about JRR Tolkien it makes total sense. The Hobbit was written to a younger audience who would be adults by the time Lord of the Rings was published. Amazing, talk about attention to detail.Read this book if you haven't yet, it is simply fantastic. There is beautiful imagery, sword fights, dragons and trolls, what's not to love.
__label__2 AMAZING: This is the best book ever, as it explains many things and story's in the Lord of the rings book.
__label__2 Classic: There's nothing bad to say about this book! Everyone should read it before they die. Great, entertaining book for anyone.
__label__1 Don't buy the audiobook: Please note that this review is specifically about the non-BBC audiobook version.I adore "The Hobbit." My first memory of my father is hearing him read the first page of the book to me as a very young child, and I've read the book countless times since then. Given my long commute currently, I've become a big fan of audiobooks. I picked this up with high hopes.What a let down. The audiobook is abridged, although the package didn't note that anywhere, the abridgement choices are odd at best (leave in Beorn but take out almost everything of Rivendell?), the voice actors seem to be interested in portraying the characters as comically and unpleasantly as possible (I want to give all of the elves in the audiobook some throat lozenges) and to top it all off, the sound quality is incredibly poor and inconsistent....
__label__2 Hobbit: I really liked this book. The beginning was kind of slow, but if you keep on reading you can't put it down. I really like how he used the main character as a hobbit (or really small person), instead of this tall, masculine person, who works on a farm, and all the chicks dig him, because people like that have "a really hard time proving themselves".That why I like The Hobbit, because Bilbo proved himself even though he's three foot tall.It shows us that height and weight have nothing to do with our character. We could be four foot five and two hundred pounds outside, but a seven foot high one hundred forty pound body builder inside.
__label__2 I read it again after 30 years - still good read: Almost as good as The Lord of the Rings trilogy, but more of a kid's story.Very enjoyable even so
__label__1 good only for insomnia: Actually, I would prefer to give it zero stars. In a number of attempts to read this thing, I succeeded in falling asleep every time. In ten or so attempts I was able to get no further than page 15. So dull.
__label__1 The hobbit: Disappointed didnt receive the item at all and the transaction said it was successful even got an email confirmation saying my order was successful
__label__1 LOTR is better: i didn't like this book very much. it seemed more like a children's book compared to lotr. Just an opinion
__label__2 Good: Quick and e as y read. Pictures are to large had to continually turn book to see them. Good digital copy.
__label__2 Slow but good story: This book takes a while to get into but I guess that is to be expected with an older novel and with Tolkien's writing style. However a good story overall and worth reading.
__label__2 The hobbit: I am not much of a reader but I must say I really liked it had little dragged out spots very adventures
__label__1 Am I missing something?: I read "The Lord of the Rings" trilogy before the movies came out in anticipation of them, having always put them off for one reason or another. Naturally I was drawn to this book afterwards as a way of looking for some of the background to the story. Honestly, I don't know what it is and hate myself for saying this, but I simply did not like this book. I'm not sure if it's the style of the narration or what it is, but I found it a struggle to read. I normally read until the end of a chapter and then stop for the time being, but with The Hobbit I found I could barely get through one chapter in a sitting. I know that many are going to hammer me as "not helpful" for knocking the book, but I just want readers to understand that this book, much like LOTR, is not for everyone. The LOTR is a much better read than this one, and in my opinion The Hobbit is really only a necessary read for those diehard fans who really need to know where it all began.
__label__1 Little people versus a huge dragon: The little people win, of course, but boy does it take awhile for THAT to happen.
__label__2 Great book to a Great Series...: First off I gave this book a four because, in my opinion, it was not as good as Lord of the Rings which I proudly would rate a five. Writers mature, getting better in their writing style on their second/third book. Tolkien did a fabulous job on the Hobbit. Humor, confilct, but no romance. Good for children, good for just anyone. I thought Bilbo to be hilarous, the dwarfs just as funny. A true classic was the Hobbit that it will remain on my "read again" books forever, until I die of course. If you haven't read it yet I highly recommed for anyone who is looking for a good book to try this one out. I know others have said it, and I won't be the last but Tolkien was a master writer of our time!!
__label__2 Some people...: Do you find it interesting that all the people giving this excellent book a rating of one have dozens of spelling and grammar errors in their reviews? I think that is just about the least shocking thing I have ever seen. And can anyone tell me where the schools that "make" students read Tolkien are? At my school we have to read crap like "The Scarlet Letter". I am jealous of you people who were "forced" to read this book! In the sixth grade my teacher suggested that I read "The Hobbit" and L.O.T.R. Since then I have been a Fantasy MANIAC! I followed it up with Terry Brooks and Death Gate and I haven't stopped yet. I owe it all to The Hobbit! How could anyone not like this book?
__label__2 Good Book but no music on Kindle Touch: The book is fantantic, with lots of information and figures.The only issue resides on the missing habilitie of the kindle touch to reproduce the authors voice on poems and music inside the book, this can only be done in Fire version or Kindle for Iphone or Ipad, not even on Kindle for PC. I really can't understand!
__label__1 Poor edition for Amazon's own Kindle Fire HD: I do wish I could review the book separately from the edition. But you cannot so let it be known this is about the edition. For whatever reason Amazon has decided to provide this book in its' most complete form only on the iphone/ipad. The book on the iOS platform has the audio available within it. However, on Amazon's very own Kindle Fire HD that feature is not available. Kudo's to Amazon for telling you that up front but I find it really sad that Amazon does not fully support its' own platform.
__label__2 awesome little book: This is the second time I've read the Hobbit but the first time I have owned it. It is an absolutely beautiful copy....gilded pages, leather cover with embossing, and a handful of illustrations. Definitely worth purchasing!
__label__2 This book is absolutely the best!: I read this book 10 years ago, and it has never left me since! Bilbo is an inspiration to us all! You can see yourself in his character. I have been suggesting this book to all of my friends since I read it, and each one who's read it thanked me immensly for introducing them to the world of Tolkien. Now I'm tackling the "Lord of the Rings Trilogy"....
__label__2 Gorgeous Book: I had recently saw the movie and was intrigued to find out how the story ends so I bought the book. I'm not a big reader and have never liked paperback size 4 font books and this was def an excellent choice for me. Its an easy read and the bigger spaced out font just makes it more enjoyable to read for an extended amount of time. Its absolutely gorgeous and will look great on the bookshelf when I'm finished.
__label__2 Wonderful!!!: I have read J.R.R. Tolkien's The Hobbit, and I think that it is a great book!! I recommend it to everybody!! It is my favorite book.
__label__2 A Fine Beginning: While Tolkien was nowhere near as excellent of a writer at this point as he would become years later with the Lord of the Rings, the Hobbit is still an enjoyable introduction to Middle Earth. The story is more simple and the flow is more like reading a fable or children's story to me compared with the more serious and high fantasy style of the Lord of the Rings. The Hobbit is more fast paced. There is more action happening all the time but it's not as atmospheric. This is the story of Bilbo joining a band of dwarves to go get treasure from a dragon named Smaug. Along the way he braves many dangers such as orcs, trolls, giant spiders and meets Gollum and finds a ring. It's a good prelude but nothing amazing. However, the book does hold a special place for me because I found a copy in my parents book collection in the basement when I was a kid and it became the first book I ever read. I owe Tolkien a thank you for hooking me on books.
